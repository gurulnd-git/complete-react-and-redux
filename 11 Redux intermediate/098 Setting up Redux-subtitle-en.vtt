WEBVTT

00:00.870 --> 00:06.800
OK it seems we can use redux we going to need to hook up redux to our application we need to do the

00:06.800 --> 00:07.810
setup first.

00:07.970 --> 00:15.470
So we need to import a few things to use redux going to go right here at the top and we get to import

00:15.530 --> 00:18.500
and the first thing we need to import for redux.

00:18.530 --> 00:19.890
It's going to be the provider.

00:20.090 --> 00:26.660
So I'm going to say provider and the provider comes not for redux but from re-act redux.

00:26.700 --> 00:32.270
I'm going to say from and it's going to be re-act redux us OK.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.610
We have the provider now from redux.

00:34.610 --> 00:40.660
We need to use the create store and the Apply middleware and we are going to use middle words and this

00:40.660 --> 00:52.730
section and can say import and then just create store create store and then we need to bring the middleware

00:52.820 --> 00:53.130
one.

00:53.150 --> 01:01.240
So we're going to say coma and then apply and the middleware There we go.

01:01.630 --> 01:04.810
Nice to begin to bring this one from Britax.

01:05.140 --> 01:07.830
I'm going to say Widex Let's get.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.360
So we have to create store and we apply middleware that's fine.

01:11.380 --> 01:11.650
OK.

01:11.650 --> 01:17.740
So we need to wrap everything inside a provider and inside the provider we set a store and the store

01:17.830 --> 01:20.330
user uses a function.

01:20.350 --> 01:22.140
So I'm going to create a function right now.

01:22.180 --> 01:30.310
It's going to be Konst and then create store and then with middleware.

01:30.850 --> 01:31.460
Right.

01:31.840 --> 01:36.250
So this one is going to be going to use the Apply middleware we're using right here which is spring

01:36.250 --> 01:36.970
right here.

01:37.150 --> 01:39.330
And this one is going to be equal to function.

01:39.460 --> 01:42.480
And what we do right here we create a store.

01:42.520 --> 01:49.180
So I'm going to say create store just like that.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.350
I made a mistake here to create store.

01:51.370 --> 01:56.170
It's not with a capital C just with it just a V with a C.

01:56.170 --> 01:58.460
So I'm going to do it just like that.

01:58.860 --> 01:59.280
OK.

01:59.340 --> 01:59.880
Very good.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.910
So now we need to wrap everything inside a provider.

02:03.910 --> 02:12.760
So I'm going to say provider and notice I'm just doing this manually and I'm not using Emett to wrap

02:12.790 --> 02:16.640
everything inside a div you know maybe you don't know how to use M.F..

02:16.720 --> 02:19.320
So I'm just doing it this way just in case.

02:19.650 --> 02:20.040
OK.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.740
So we have the provider.

02:21.790 --> 02:25.020
So the next thing we need to do is to create a store.

02:25.390 --> 02:33.400
So whenever we create a store we use the curly braces we're going to use the Kohn's devival be created

02:33.400 --> 02:36.820
right here and this creates store with middleware.

02:36.940 --> 02:44.590
It's going to take on arguments and the argument is going to be all the reducers we get all the reducers.

02:44.710 --> 02:49.070
So we're going to say reducers right let's get.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.760
So we have the reducers.

02:50.820 --> 02:51.800
Now what do we need to do.

02:51.800 --> 02:58.020
I'm going to import the reducers right here at the top so I'm going to say inport and then we're going

02:58.020 --> 03:04.530
to say we do Sir's from and then we're going to bring everything from we juicers.

03:04.560 --> 03:09.180
We didn't have that final yet but we can create it in two in a minute.

03:09.630 --> 03:10.060
OK.

03:10.110 --> 03:16.310
So it's going to be reducers Burguet everything it looks ready right here.

03:16.550 --> 03:18.910
So I'm going to go to the reducers.

03:19.100 --> 03:23.280
I'm going to create our Index for the reducers index.

03:23.590 --> 03:24.700
Yes.

03:25.430 --> 03:25.700
OK.

03:25.700 --> 03:31.220
So inside the Indic that yes we need to combine combine all the reducers.

03:31.220 --> 03:39.560
So I'm going to say important and I'm going to bring combine reducers from Britax combined we do Sir's

03:40.040 --> 03:43.780
and maybe you notice that it's always the same steps at the beginning.

03:43.820 --> 03:50.210
You know this is the same thing we did previously in the U.S. and there is this one prematch again same

03:50.210 --> 03:50.810
thing.

03:50.870 --> 03:54.640
So I'm going to say from and then redux.

03:55.400 --> 04:02.350
OK so now we need to create verbal that it's going to be combining all the reducers.

04:02.450 --> 04:06.910
So I'm going to say Konst and it's going to be rude reducer.

04:07.010 --> 04:09.500
And again this name it's a convention.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.360
So we're going to say combine reducers.

04:12.720 --> 04:17.760
This is going to be a function and takes and takes just an object.

04:17.820 --> 04:20.160
For now we're going to just leave it empty.

04:20.180 --> 04:26.990
Now what we need to do is to we need to make this brute reducer available inside the index digest.

04:27.140 --> 04:32.650
So we're going to say export default and then just route reduce or

04:36.240 --> 04:41.460
so right here we're going to have it's going to work but we can have an error message that says the

04:41.460 --> 04:45.740
store does not have a valid reduce or it's because we didn't have any reducers.

04:45.750 --> 04:51.570
Right now it's just empty but we're not going to go with the reducers we're going to do the do it in

04:51.570 --> 04:52.470
the opposite way.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.230
On the previous section we created the reducer first.

04:56.370 --> 05:03.330
But now since we can to use middleware is it going to be easier to explain if we go directly to create

05:03.750 --> 05:10.320
the link inside the search you know the set up for us and then go into the actual creator.

05:10.330 --> 05:12.340
We're going to start from there.

05:12.360 --> 05:17.310
So let's go to the site to the next section and we will start to creating all the set up for this.
