00:01.230 --> 00:05.940
OK so let's add a car that's out of her to the car detail.

00:05.980 --> 00:07.840
You know it's pretty much the same idea.

00:07.860 --> 00:11.040
I'm going to delete this from the previous section.

00:11.250 --> 00:17.430
And you know the other version the other type using array you have to create a new file and everything

00:17.430 --> 00:18.960
else right here.

00:18.960 --> 00:24.470
We don't need to do that again it just copy all of this and just paste it at the bottom.

00:24.540 --> 00:31.050
Just real simple the action that we are calling right here is going to be called Car detail such as

00:31.050 --> 00:37.170
going to put car detail inside here and again which is what you want to keep the state and instead of

00:37.560 --> 00:42.500
storing everything inside a list we can stored inside instead of a different place.

00:42.570 --> 00:48.030
We can say detail for example.

00:48.210 --> 00:48.660
That's fine.

00:48.660 --> 00:57.360
So now if I go to 4 it is going to go right here if we go to a car or closet if I go to car and inside

00:57.360 --> 01:00.320
the maps that prompts we have to cancel look to state.

01:00.390 --> 01:04.120
So we should be able to see right here inside the object.

01:04.290 --> 01:11.510
So I'm going to go over to Fort and let me just bring the car producer right now.

01:11.620 --> 01:12.180
OK.

01:12.420 --> 01:13.800
So you can have it right here.

01:14.140 --> 01:17.320
So I'm going to search for Ford to get the list.

01:17.380 --> 01:18.840
I'm going to click in Mustang.

01:19.060 --> 01:22.390
It's going to take us to the to the details I mean.

01:22.600 --> 01:26.610
And I got to just open this and check if I have the information.

01:26.820 --> 01:27.330
We do.

01:27.520 --> 01:34.870
We have a list the list of four cars and inside detail we have the information of the car here.

01:34.930 --> 01:36.090
So it's good.

01:36.130 --> 01:41.440
We are using an object to store different different kind of different types of information.

01:41.500 --> 01:47.740
They're going to give you one freebie right now we are whenever we call a detail we return the state

01:48.220 --> 01:50.800
and we returned a detail.

01:51.100 --> 01:54.340
You can return more things we can add more things to the state.

01:54.340 --> 02:03.640
For example if I say right here and Rosek know whatever is a color and then set it to true.

02:03.640 --> 02:09.660
This one whenever we we run this reducer is going to add something that is true.

02:09.700 --> 02:13.240
So you can just put it to pass things.

02:13.240 --> 02:20.500
And for example if you go back and we fetch some information which is changed is to call false or whatever.

02:20.530 --> 02:25.380
So if I go right here inside the car let me just start the cycle again.

02:25.540 --> 02:28.460
Going to say Ford beget cars.

02:29.180 --> 02:31.990
Cars and the color is going to be false.

02:32.030 --> 02:33.170
And the list of four.

02:33.260 --> 02:36.190
So we can put more data right here if you wanted to.

02:36.410 --> 02:39.730
If I go to Mustang I get to go to cars.

02:39.890 --> 02:45.680
And now he's going to keep state added detail and change the color we had from before.

02:45.690 --> 02:47.420
True right.

02:47.480 --> 02:48.880
So color is true.

02:48.950 --> 02:51.500
We have a detail and then we have a list.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.140
Right.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.900
So that is working.

02:53.930 --> 02:55.590
It's working really nice.

02:55.850 --> 03:03.470
So now what we need to do we need to go back to cars and create create the loop for this to map over

03:03.480 --> 03:07.570
the cars so we can just render the information right here.

03:07.570 --> 03:13.130
We're going to do it on the next section because it's kind of the assassin just elements of S..

03:13.250 --> 03:15.680
Maybe it's boring and you don't want to do it.

03:15.680 --> 03:16.890
That's fine it's up to you.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.140
Let's go to the next section.
