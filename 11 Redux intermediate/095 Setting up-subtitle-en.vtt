00:01.310 --> 00:06.690
OK so we're going to start with a new project I've made to create create re-act app.

00:06.950 --> 00:13.430
Just a simple template and just like always I'm just deleting everything and just leaving the index

00:13.520 --> 00:18.740
that jazz and the index that HVM L.

00:19.010 --> 00:19.460
OK.

00:19.670 --> 00:20.330
So that's fine.

00:20.330 --> 00:27.470
So let me show you a mockup of what we can do so we can build just a simple application just learned

00:27.560 --> 00:31.500
a little bit about a little bit more about redux.

00:31.520 --> 00:37.640
So whenever the page loads begin to have a simple header and we can have some items right here with

00:37.640 --> 00:38.790
cars.

00:38.950 --> 00:44.400
Now whenever the page loads we can have a list of all the cars we have on the database.

00:44.570 --> 00:50.900
And then whenever we click on a car it's going to show you the it's going to show us the in the detail

00:50.970 --> 00:52.190
detail of the car.

00:52.280 --> 00:52.740
OK.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.130
Just simple as that.

00:54.170 --> 00:57.330
So I'm just going to minimize this and we need to do some set up.

00:57.350 --> 01:00.450
We need to install some things on the project.

01:00.460 --> 01:06.770
I deleted everything just like before and since we are going to work with redux we can just use some

01:06.770 --> 01:08.840
folders to go to source.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.940
I'm going to create a new folder.

01:10.940 --> 01:14.420
This one is going to be actions that need actions.

01:15.440 --> 01:19.260
We're going to need a new folder for containers.

01:19.410 --> 01:22.150
We're going to use containers.

01:22.340 --> 01:27.740
We're going to need a new folder for reducers.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.030
Right.

01:29.070 --> 01:31.030
And you fall there for components.

01:31.070 --> 01:35.060
So I'm going to say components right.

01:35.060 --> 01:39.270
So the main entry point of our application is going to be app.

01:39.280 --> 01:40.910
We're going to start from there.

01:40.940 --> 01:47.120
So I'm going to go to components and again I'm going to create a new file that is going to be app app

01:47.120 --> 01:50.270
that as simple as that.

01:50.540 --> 01:56.090
Since this is just it's going to start as a simple component I'm going to import re-act from react.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.800
I'm going to make a class component.

01:57.860 --> 02:02.020
So it's going to be components are going to go right here.

02:02.030 --> 02:07.470
Can I say class and then just on no app makes sense.

02:08.750 --> 02:13.550
And this one is going to be extensive and then just components just like before.

02:14.150 --> 02:20.200
This one just just to put a friend there so we can get something on the screen whenever the page loads.

02:20.220 --> 02:26.410
So we're going to say render it inside the render we can return some GSX so is going to say we turn

02:26.690 --> 02:32.060
and then just a simple div just something simple hello.

02:32.570 --> 02:36.470
And of course we need to export this components.

02:36.570 --> 02:39.580
I'm going to say export default.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.510
And then just app.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.750
All right that's good.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.770
Now I'm going to go to the index database.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.810
I'm going to import that of components.

02:49.040 --> 02:57.620
So I'm going to say app from and then dot for Slash components for Slash at that jazz that's going to

02:57.620 --> 02:58.980
work OK.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.300
So what do we need we need to install a lot of things.

03:02.450 --> 03:06.500
So we need to install redux and react redux.

03:06.500 --> 03:15.440
So I'm going to go right here to the terminal and I'm going to say OK I'm going to say NPM install redux.

03:15.470 --> 03:16.650
That's the first thing.

03:16.970 --> 03:22.280
It's going to be mine amount minus minus safe and click enter and then I'm going to pass the video because

03:22.280 --> 03:23.690
it's going to take a couple minutes.

03:25.460 --> 03:26.600
OK so this is done.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.130
We need to install re-act redux.

03:29.300 --> 03:39.740
So again and PM install and then re-act redux and then mine is mine is safe again just kind of Ponzo

03:39.740 --> 03:40.060
BDO.

03:40.060 --> 03:41.310
Be right back.

03:42.740 --> 03:45.200
All right so we can do anything we can to use routes.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.160
So we need to install re-act router.

03:48.320 --> 03:57.270
So I'm going to say NPM install and then re-act router and then just Dohm right.

03:57.290 --> 04:05.100
It's going to be out and it's going to be the person for 0 0 and then just minus minus save.

04:05.600 --> 04:05.930
All right.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.870
Again going to pass the BDA.

04:09.290 --> 04:14.950
OK so we're going to be calling making calls to an API and begin to use Jason's server for this.

04:14.990 --> 04:21.270
So I'm going to go right here to the root of our application and I'm going to create a new file and

04:21.290 --> 04:24.750
you file and it's going to be divi dad.

04:24.800 --> 04:29.190
Jason just like that divi that Jason and it's going to be just empty.

04:29.480 --> 04:30.080
OK.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.900
And we need to install Dayson server.

04:33.110 --> 04:40.310
Now if you don't have it installed globally Here's the command you need to NPM install minus D and then

04:40.310 --> 04:41.280
Jason's server.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.570
That's what you need to do.

04:42.710 --> 04:46.660
I'm never going to install it because I already have it.

04:46.730 --> 04:50.180
So we need to start to server I'm going to go to a new tab.

04:50.210 --> 04:51.250
Right here when you click.

04:51.260 --> 04:53.960
Plus it's going to take you to a new tab.

04:54.170 --> 05:00.420
And if we do Jason Dasch server then minus minus watch TV that Jason is the one we have right here.

05:00.800 --> 05:08.500
And then port and 3 0 0 4 we click enter is going to start everything for us and we can have an API

05:08.540 --> 05:09.700
just in one minute.

05:09.930 --> 05:10.830
It's very good.

05:11.030 --> 05:11.960
I love this.

05:11.960 --> 05:12.990
Jason server.

05:13.330 --> 05:13.820
OK.

05:14.150 --> 05:19.040
So everything it's ready so we can start as soon as this is ready.

05:19.320 --> 05:19.600
OK.

05:19.670 --> 05:21.950
So everything is fine it's fine.

05:21.950 --> 05:28.190
So I'm going to go to mine to the first one to the first terminal and I'm going to do.

05:28.190 --> 05:29.540
NPM start

05:32.650 --> 05:34.630
all right it's going to take a few seconds.

05:34.870 --> 05:40.260
And as soon as it's done you should be getting the hello.

05:40.560 --> 05:46.540
We have right here on the local host 3000 is going to reload the page and we get hello.

05:46.590 --> 05:49.390
So that's good you know very very fast.

05:49.560 --> 05:55.440
So let's go to the next section and start creating the components for our tiny application.
