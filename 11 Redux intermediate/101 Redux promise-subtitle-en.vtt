00:00.580 --> 00:07.090
OK so now we need to make use of this Rydex premise and I'm sorry that sometimes I say redux instead

00:07.090 --> 00:12.540
of redux you know with different accent because in my country they'd say redux.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.700
You know it's confusing for me.

00:15.700 --> 00:16.750
I'm sorry for that.

00:16.960 --> 00:18.210
Let's keep moving forward.

00:18.220 --> 00:21.540
If I say redux you know that it's redux that's fine.

00:21.550 --> 00:23.130
We need to install this promise.

00:23.140 --> 00:25.390
The real problem is that this middleware.

00:25.660 --> 00:27.500
So we get to go to the terminal.

00:27.510 --> 00:30.150
I'm going to say View integrated terminal.

00:30.370 --> 00:36.970
And whenever you install new dependencies it's always good to kill the process right here.

00:37.210 --> 00:41.830
So in Windows if you do Control-C is going to ask a terminal BATSHAW.

00:41.850 --> 00:42.340
Yes.

00:42.430 --> 00:43.570
Did you just yes.

00:43.700 --> 00:46.400
If your Mac is going to be Kamensky.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.060
No real simple.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.320
So we need to install redux promise.

00:50.380 --> 01:00.880
So I'm going to say NPM install and then read UX and then promise promise it is going to be mine is

01:00.880 --> 01:04.370
mine to save and he's going to do all the installing.

01:04.460 --> 01:09.280
It's not just that just a few seconds but I'm going to just pause the video just to make it make everything

01:09.280 --> 01:09.920
faster.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.210
Right so everything is installed.

01:13.330 --> 01:15.150
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to do.

01:15.220 --> 01:17.980
PM start again.

01:17.980 --> 01:19.190
All right.

01:19.190 --> 01:20.550
We're going to bring this down.

01:21.660 --> 01:22.310
And right.

01:22.330 --> 01:25.800
So we need to connect this redux promise.

01:25.830 --> 01:27.890
It's install on our computer.

01:27.940 --> 01:29.370
So we need to do some set up.

01:29.410 --> 01:35.320
I'm going to go I'm going to go to the index dodginess and the worry is set up it's really really simple.

01:35.320 --> 01:38.470
We have it ready for for us right here.

01:38.470 --> 01:44.080
So what we need to do first see since we installed a new dependency we need to import that.

01:44.140 --> 01:52.140
So I'm going to say import and it's going to call promise made aware.

01:52.220 --> 01:52.500
All right.

01:52.540 --> 01:58.870
That's fine and is going to say from and it's going to be redux promise.

01:59.190 --> 02:01.200
Very good.

02:02.200 --> 02:11.320
So now in order to use this what we do we just can't just copy this and we go right here inside apply

02:11.320 --> 02:13.810
middleware and we just put it right here.

02:14.050 --> 02:15.480
It's that simple.

02:15.700 --> 02:21.370
If you have more hours maybe to do something else because you could have a lot of malwares you just

02:21.490 --> 02:26.770
just stacking them there just coma and you add and you were just simple as that.

02:27.130 --> 02:33.110
So since you're going to use just for now the promise the redox promise is just going to use one.

02:33.430 --> 02:34.630
OK that's good.

02:35.020 --> 02:41.370
So if I just reload the page and go right here and type for it.

02:41.850 --> 02:43.180
OK that's good.

02:43.180 --> 02:45.540
Notice that we get the type we get the payload.

02:45.730 --> 02:50.780
And this we now we get a response and we are not getting that promise.

02:50.830 --> 02:55.200
So I'm going to go right here and just open all this.

02:55.590 --> 03:02.290
Ok we get a payload and get a lot of data on the payload you know have the body headers.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.460
You have a lot of information and we have one more problem that we need to solve.

03:06.460 --> 03:12.430
We have a lot of information but the data it's not like here it's not a it's not a promise or something

03:12.430 --> 03:14.720
else but we don't have the data.

03:14.890 --> 03:20.660
Now the thing is that with fetch We need to do something else the response the actual Jason.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.420
It's not available in there.

03:22.420 --> 03:25.760
We need to do some more set up with fetch.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.350
And that's why I use Axel's.

03:27.370 --> 03:29.570
It's simpler actually.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.580
Whenever you call ASIO's is going to give you the actual Jason.

03:32.620 --> 03:34.410
You don't need to do more set up.

03:34.420 --> 03:40.820
So what we need to do right here we need to do that then we can use then and then inside here we're

03:40.880 --> 03:46.640
going to call that response and then the response is going to be equal to.

03:46.660 --> 03:54.530
And we can at we convert the response to Jason's response and then Jason and we convert everything.

03:54.850 --> 03:58.610
So this is it's going to do it's going to grab that response we're getting.

03:58.690 --> 04:06.280
And it's just fetching that Jason the data we need and it's good to return that response.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.600
You know is going to sign.

04:07.600 --> 04:12.120
Response to response responses Jason so I'm going to do forward.

04:12.390 --> 04:18.330
And this time instead of a response we get the actual Jasen the array of data.

04:18.580 --> 04:19.190
Right.

04:19.270 --> 04:20.910
So that is working.

04:21.070 --> 04:27.130
You know it was a lot of work just to get this working but now it's available and we can do a lot of

04:27.130 --> 04:28.410
things with this.

04:28.410 --> 04:29.150
So OK.

04:29.260 --> 04:31.640
Let's go to the next section.

04:31.960 --> 04:38.260
We can begin to grab this information we can to create a reduce or to grab this information the one

04:38.260 --> 04:44.530
that we are getting right here because as for now we are calling the we do sorry we are just canceling

04:44.980 --> 04:46.040
the data we are.

04:46.050 --> 04:52.030
We are getting to ground this data create the actual reducer and whenever we get this information we

04:52.030 --> 04:54.880
will update the results state with this.
