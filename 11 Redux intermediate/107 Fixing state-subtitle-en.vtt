00:00.960 --> 00:05.750
OK so we need to make this redux state a little bit more dynamic.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.090
So I'm going to go back I'm going to just go back some some things because we're not going to need them.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.510
We're going to do it on a different way.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.220
We're going to do some refactoring.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.070
So I'm going to delete this card detail call from here.

00:17.200 --> 00:22.710
We're going to delete all the card detail and leave everything in sight card so we can store everything

00:22.710 --> 00:29.120
inside cars are going to go to the source and the lead card detail goodbye card detail.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.850
We don't need to any more.

00:30.860 --> 00:31.340
Goodbye.

00:31.410 --> 00:32.020
OK.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.770
So OK that's fine.

00:34.020 --> 00:40.530
So now we will need to do something in order to mutate this estate.

00:40.590 --> 00:42.640
You're right now using an array.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.760
So we need to use something else.

00:44.750 --> 00:50.940
We are going to use an object so whenever the application loads this it's going to be equal to an object

00:51.190 --> 00:51.630
that's good.

00:51.660 --> 00:54.120
That's the first thing we need to do.

00:54.120 --> 00:58.780
Now I'm going to I'm going to change this and I'm going to get some errors right.

00:58.810 --> 01:00.350
Love just like here cars map.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.620
It's not a function.

01:01.890 --> 01:08.430
Now right here instead of returning the actual payload we need to return something else.

01:08.430 --> 01:10.500
We need to return an object.

01:10.680 --> 01:16.310
So I'm going to re delete the action that payload and I get to return an object just like that.

01:17.990 --> 01:23.730
Now whenever we return this the problem is that we have a previous state.

01:23.870 --> 01:29.210
Now right here there's nothing we know that there is nothing but maybe in the future or in a different

01:29.300 --> 01:33.200
application you can have a state with some default data.

01:33.380 --> 01:41.870
Let's say that you have Konst and state and this inside this estate you can have a name it or whatever

01:42.230 --> 01:45.920
then you're going to have I don't know a last name just like that.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.890
Just last name whatever.

01:48.500 --> 01:53.600
And then you can have a list which is going to be our list of course that at the beginning is going

01:53.600 --> 01:57.580
to start as empty just an empty an empty list.

01:57.580 --> 01:58.210
Very good.

01:58.610 --> 02:00.390
So the application is going to start.

02:00.650 --> 02:04.850
It's going to create the state is going to do all the logic logical store the names toward the last

02:04.850 --> 02:12.020
name then whenever we click on a car is going to go through the reducers and it will trigger the search

02:12.020 --> 02:13.150
cars.

02:13.160 --> 02:20.540
Now the thing is that if we return the state only with the payload is going to delete pretty much the

02:20.540 --> 02:26.570
whole information because we're saying OK now the state is going to be equal to the list if i do list

02:27.260 --> 02:34.140
and then action that payload we're going to have a problem.

02:34.180 --> 02:38.280
We say that the state is only list action that payload.

02:38.330 --> 02:42.230
So we need to do something else to modify the state of list.

02:42.440 --> 02:46.420
But to keep everything else that we had in the state previously.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.820
So what we do is going to be dot dot dot.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.620
And we do a state and then coma.

02:53.360 --> 02:58.180
And this is not redux and it's not react this it's ESX.

02:58.220 --> 03:03.890
So privacy we are including everything that was on the previous state and then we just modified the

03:03.890 --> 03:07.350
list or we add a list if it doesn't exist.

03:07.720 --> 03:08.160
OK.

03:08.390 --> 03:14.080
So this one should be working now I'm going to go and right now we get karst map.

03:14.090 --> 03:21.080
It's not a function it's because inside a list of cars we're calling to something that doesn't exist

03:21.080 --> 03:21.450
anymore.

03:21.470 --> 03:22.570
We changed it.

03:22.730 --> 03:28.860
Now instead of looking inside of cars we need to look inside cars that list.

03:29.270 --> 03:34.480
So I want to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to change some things.

03:34.640 --> 03:43.090
I'm going to just cancel this before just cancel right now right here.

03:43.130 --> 03:49.240
I have the console log of the map state prompts and I'm going to just look for forward.

03:50.150 --> 03:54.290
And if you notice right here just let me show you I'm going to make this bigger.

03:54.290 --> 03:58.780
If I open the screen a little bit you can see right here that we have a car.

03:59.180 --> 04:04.430
This is the pre-state and right here inside we have an object of course.

04:04.470 --> 04:05.170
All right.

04:05.180 --> 04:07.090
And inside of course it's empty.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.630
If I search for four

04:12.570 --> 04:18.830
right here you can have cars that cars and a list.

04:18.840 --> 04:20.580
So we have our list of course.

04:20.850 --> 04:25.410
And if we look for something else inside the reducers we're going to put it after this.

04:25.410 --> 04:26.770
We're going to do that in a minute.

04:27.070 --> 04:32.940
So OK so we too we have access to cars and list and we have a list of course.

04:32.970 --> 04:38.140
So right here pretty much we don't have to do much right here.

04:38.490 --> 04:40.390
This one is going to stay the same.

04:40.470 --> 04:43.980
But right here we are making reference to this that prompts.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.120
So what are you going to do.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.950
I'm going to just change it to this.

04:47.070 --> 04:52.050
The probs the cars so we can access this cars.

04:52.380 --> 04:56.710
They go back there you go.

04:56.750 --> 05:03.950
So now on the map since you have access to this that prompts that cars instead of accessing to cars

05:04.160 --> 05:06.480
we need to access the list.

05:06.670 --> 05:13.330
You can go right here and say list and if we have a list you can loop and map that list.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.250
OK.

05:16.590 --> 05:18.770
So everything starts at zero.

05:18.780 --> 05:20.850
We have an empty object.

05:20.850 --> 05:29.100
And if I look for Fort Bliss to Fort the list of course directly from the object right here.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.620
So this is working.

05:31.010 --> 05:36.340
Now what we need to do we need to do pretty much the same thing with the car detail.

05:36.350 --> 05:38.060
Let's go to the next section and do that.

05:38.060 --> 05:39.010
It's going to be real simple.
