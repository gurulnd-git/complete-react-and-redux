WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:03.210
OK so let's create the card detail for this.

00:03.240 --> 00:09.750
Now I've made a mistake in the list of course I've chosen to put cars instead of car.

00:09.790 --> 00:13.050
So it's going to be Singler If not it's just going to fail.

00:13.090 --> 00:19.210
So we have our car components and this car Daniele's is going to be inside components.

00:19.240 --> 00:25.280
So if I just type Ford got the whistles and click on this I'm going to get the car.

00:25.340 --> 00:30.430
The thing is I don't want this component right here inside components because this one is going to be

00:30.550 --> 00:32.110
linked to redux.

00:32.110 --> 00:33.370
So it should be a container.

00:33.400 --> 00:39.270
So I'm going to grab this and promoed to a container or to just put it inside the containers folder.

00:39.490 --> 00:43.220
I'm going to go to this and I'm going to change containers.

00:46.430 --> 00:46.850
OK.

00:46.910 --> 00:47.320
That's good.

00:47.330 --> 00:48.990
We still got car.

00:49.190 --> 00:49.750
That's right.

00:49.940 --> 00:52.850
So I'm going to close this and I'm going to go back to cars.

00:53.060 --> 00:55.420
Now we need to create all the logic for this.

00:55.420 --> 00:57.810
We need to import a lot of things.

00:57.830 --> 01:03.980
So what we need to import first is going to be imports are going to do import and we're going to bring

01:04.070 --> 01:11.330
Kinect from re-act redux and the From and re-act redux.

01:11.590 --> 01:12.430
Right.

01:12.650 --> 01:15.710
The next thing we're going to need is going to be the action creator.

01:15.860 --> 01:17.190
So we're going to import.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.560
And we didn't have the action.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.610
I'm just going to create it right now.

01:20.660 --> 01:24.480
It's going to be car detail and we're going to get an answer for this.

01:24.680 --> 01:25.700
But doesn't matter.

01:25.820 --> 01:29.590
So it's going to be from and we're going to bring it from actions.

01:29.780 --> 01:33.760
So it's going to be dotted for actions.

01:33.920 --> 01:34.400
Right.

01:34.410 --> 01:35.370
Let's get.

01:35.400 --> 01:42.570
So now whenever we click on it on an item it's going to take us to a new a view and this view is going

01:42.570 --> 01:44.430
to do two things.

01:44.430 --> 01:49.690
First it's going to dispatch an action to bring the data for this car.

01:49.800 --> 01:57.630
So we will need map this patch to props from redux and we will need since we need map dispatch prompts

01:57.990 --> 02:00.370
we need to use bind action creators.

02:00.510 --> 02:09.150
So I'm going to say import and I are going to bring bind action creators and this one is going to be

02:09.150 --> 02:11.790
from burritos and missing from.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.010
And then redux right.

02:16.120 --> 02:24.000
Breguet So now whenever we felt we trigger the action and we fetched the data we need to change inject

02:24.120 --> 02:29.040
that data inside the component so we can render the GSX with all the data.

02:29.220 --> 02:33.710
So since we need to inject the prompts we will need the maps data prompts.

02:33.970 --> 02:34.410
OK.

02:34.560 --> 02:42.840
So I'm going to go right here the bottom and I'm going to say function and bring the map state to prop's

02:43.880 --> 02:52.980
this map state prompts it's going to take an argument the state is going to be state.

02:53.330 --> 03:00.080
Now this function is going to return an object so I'm going to say return and just an object.

03:00.120 --> 03:05.210
Now we can have a lot of problems with this and we are going to be solving the issues as we go.

03:05.420 --> 03:13.820
So I'm going to say car and inside car we will bring the state and then something that car calls card

03:13.830 --> 03:16.300
detail just like that.

03:17.120 --> 03:22.370
And then I'm going to tilt and then begin to discuss why we're doing this and why we will need to change

03:22.760 --> 03:23.710
some things.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.460
OK that's good.

03:25.490 --> 03:26.960
We have the maps major props.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.300
We all need to do the map dispatch to prompts.

03:30.360 --> 03:38.950
So I'm going to say function and then map this patch to prop's right.

03:38.990 --> 03:41.660
This one takes dispatch as an argument.

03:41.690 --> 03:48.730
So I'm going to say this patch right now what else we need to return the bind auction creators.

03:48.860 --> 03:57.450
So I'm going to say return and then bind auction creators get by and there you go.

03:57.550 --> 04:01.150
Now this bind auction creators takes two arguments.

04:01.150 --> 04:03.080
First it's going to be the action.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.700
And this case is going to be car.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.760
It's going to be called Car dieta detail.

04:06.910 --> 04:11.680
And this one is going to be equal to car car detail.

04:11.680 --> 04:17.260
Now since we are using S6 we can simplify this a little bit since we have the same name for the key

04:17.620 --> 04:20.660
and the value we can just do this and this.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.650
This one is going to be just equals this.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.290
OK.

04:23.510 --> 04:24.260
Right.

04:24.580 --> 04:29.860
The next argument that we need inside of mind actually creators is going to be the dispatch we have

04:29.860 --> 04:30.290
right here.

04:30.290 --> 04:33.170
So I'm going to copy and paste brigade.

04:33.220 --> 04:37.480
The last thing we need to do from now is going to be to do the connect.

04:37.750 --> 04:44.520
So I'm going to say export default and then connect the connect takes two.

04:44.740 --> 04:49.900
And the second one right here is going to be the actual components which in this case is going to be

04:49.900 --> 04:50.530
car.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.620
OK so I'm going to go to a car and put it right here.

04:53.620 --> 04:56.720
It's going to be using the map state to Propst the map.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.630
This batch of product prompts we need to put both.

04:59.650 --> 05:00.700
There is no null.

05:00.730 --> 05:06.740
Right here and now we're going to get an error because actions we don't have an action Creator for this

05:06.790 --> 05:08.540
and we're importing it.

05:08.590 --> 05:11.140
So that's why we get the OR that's fine.

05:11.140 --> 05:13.400
We're going to do something else right now.

05:13.570 --> 05:14.610
I'm going to open up.

05:14.750 --> 05:17.350
Let's let's go and create the action creator.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.400
We're not going to go right here.

05:19.510 --> 05:28.750
And then inside actions and we're going to go to the index of the actions Breguet now right here you

05:28.750 --> 05:32.130
can have a thousand actions doesn't matter.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.750
They are just functions.

05:33.850 --> 05:40.150
So to create a new actions a new action inside the index dodgiest we just go below this function and

05:40.150 --> 05:40.920
create a new one.

05:40.930 --> 05:47.170
So it's going to be explored and then function to simple as that and the function that we're going to

05:47.170 --> 05:49.830
be calling is going to be called carnt detail.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.230
So we use card detail simple as that.

05:53.640 --> 05:57.770
Okay I'm going to just open close and just leave it as it is.

05:57.800 --> 06:04.580
This detail is going to receive an argument and it's going to be whatever we get inside the ID.

06:04.690 --> 06:08.110
So I'm going to say Id very good.

06:08.740 --> 06:12.580
Now let's go back to cars for one second.

06:12.580 --> 06:21.050
Whenever we reach this component we need to have access to the U R L right here to the idea of the car.

06:21.040 --> 06:25.460
So if I say Ford and click a Mustang we have the number one.

06:25.570 --> 06:27.460
So we need to have access to this.

06:27.520 --> 06:34.280
Now if you remember with re-act router we already have access to this inside.

06:34.400 --> 06:38.860
Does that props up one second.

06:38.860 --> 06:41.060
Let me just create a diff container for this.

06:41.260 --> 06:44.490
If not react is going to complain.

06:44.830 --> 06:53.530
OK so it's going to be this that prompts and it's going to be inside match then it's going to be our.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.840
Yeah I believe it's match it's match.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.530
Yeah of course.

06:56.530 --> 07:00.090
Forgot for one second and then perhaps and then Id.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.520
So if I just reload the page we get the ID this that prompts that match.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.700
Perhaps I forgot about this one.

07:07.890 --> 07:08.300
Right.

07:08.320 --> 07:17.590
So what we can do now since we have the prams which you can call in inside a computer will mount an

07:17.590 --> 07:21.260
action can trigger that action with the Priam's right here.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.450
We're not going to do it right now.

07:22.450 --> 07:24.020
We're going to do it in a few minutes.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.580
So I'm going to go back to index and just complete this.

07:27.580 --> 07:31.030
Just make the network network request.

07:31.030 --> 07:32.300
We don't need to do cancel log.

07:32.290 --> 07:33.240
Again just like with it.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.260
But this we can know this.

07:35.260 --> 07:39.800
So OK so we're going to go to the card detail and I'm going to create a request.

07:39.820 --> 07:44.040
It's going to be Konst request now.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.080
Pretty much we're going to have the same thing in here.

07:47.080 --> 07:53.570
So I'm just going to copy all of this and I will just modify it you know to do the same thing.

07:53.600 --> 07:59.620
So OK we're going to be calling the card index but this time you're not going to be doing the search.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.290
We're going to search for an ID.

08:01.370 --> 08:09.820
So right here going to say I.D. And since we are passing an ID as an argument you're going to say Id

08:09.850 --> 08:12.770
for the argument something like that.

08:12.790 --> 08:16.930
So pretty much same code different arguments.

08:17.320 --> 08:17.740
OK.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.360
I'm going to go right here.

08:19.630 --> 08:23.100
And I'm just to check that everything is going fine.

08:23.260 --> 08:27.460
I'm going to cancel the request.

08:28.780 --> 08:29.350
OK.

08:29.630 --> 08:36.700
Now this action creator needs to return an object with a type and a payload.

08:36.730 --> 08:38.030
So we're going to do that right now.

08:38.050 --> 08:44.800
It's going to be we turn and go right here and he's going to say type and then this one is going to

08:44.800 --> 08:48.300
be call car detail.

08:49.000 --> 08:49.530
OK.

08:49.750 --> 08:51.610
And then we just put coma.

08:51.610 --> 08:54.490
Now this one is going to be sending a payload.

08:54.640 --> 08:58.290
So the payload is going to be equal to request

09:02.330 --> 09:02.810
OK.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.500
So everything looks fine.

09:05.620 --> 09:10.360
So we're going to go to the next section to the next video if we can if we can to do that when we create

09:10.540 --> 09:15.430
the we do search for this and we're going to have a few problems and I'm going to give you this dissolution

09:15.430 --> 09:18.700
of course but it's going to be kind of weird at the beginning.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.170
But let's go to the next section.
