00:01.180 --> 00:07.320
OK so what we want to do now is to fix the problem that we're getting whenever we have a slow connection.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.200
Let me just show you real quick.

00:09.250 --> 00:15.490
Whenever I go to Ford and then go to Mustang is going to fetch all the information because we had an

00:15.490 --> 00:18.130
empty state of this component.

00:18.370 --> 00:25.030
But if I go back and go to Fiesta it's going to flashed in previous state which was Mustang and then

00:25.030 --> 00:29.370
show the news the new stage this happens because we have a slow connection.

00:29.740 --> 00:34.480
But the thing is that we need to at something we need to do something to clear the state whenever we

00:34.480 --> 00:36.680
leave this place.

00:36.820 --> 00:40.160
And there's a there's a few ways to do this.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.340
I'm going to shoot this one because it applies to this.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.210
What are we going to do.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.780
We're going to create a reduce.

00:45.910 --> 00:47.770
To clear the state.

00:47.860 --> 00:54.480
So I'm going to go right here to cars and I'm going to go right ahead and just create a clear detailed

00:54.490 --> 00:55.360
reduce or I'm sorry.

00:55.360 --> 01:00.270
Clear detail action can say clear detail.

01:00.750 --> 01:01.570
OK.

01:01.690 --> 01:10.110
Now with the react we have a lifecycle method that is going to be component will unmount and that lifecycle

01:10.180 --> 01:14.720
is going to run whenever we leave this view of this component.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.370
So we're going to trigger this action there.

01:17.450 --> 01:24.200
Second to say component well announce Burguet.

01:24.820 --> 01:27.860
So it's a call to a function and right here.

01:28.060 --> 01:34.030
Now we're going to call an action Creator that is going to be clear detail and it's going to be available

01:34.120 --> 01:35.290
inside prompts.

01:35.350 --> 01:44.110
So we're going to say this that prompts that clear detail right this clear detail it's still not available.

01:44.110 --> 01:48.450
We need to add it right here on the map dispatched to prop's.

01:48.630 --> 01:52.810
So I'm going to do coma and then clear detail is going to be available.

01:52.810 --> 01:57.110
Of course we get an error because the action is not exported or defined.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.890
So we're going to go to actions and we can create a natural for this.

02:01.150 --> 02:07.770
I can say again just like this going to create a simple function is going to be exported.

02:08.350 --> 02:15.810
And then just function and it's going to be clear list nutter.

02:15.890 --> 02:23.560
And remember it was clear detail Well you know was pretty close.

02:23.620 --> 02:31.450
Get out put clear detail and clear out detail is going to return an object with the type of a payload

02:31.870 --> 02:38.120
the type is going to be something that makes sense clear detail right.

02:38.470 --> 02:42.160
And the payload that was real is really really simple.

02:42.160 --> 02:48.430
It's going to be payload and the payload it's going to be nothing just an empty crate.

02:49.240 --> 02:57.310
So let's copy the clear detail and add or reduce or for this to go and create a case and it's going

02:57.310 --> 02:59.500
to be clear detail.

02:59.950 --> 03:08.710
This one is going to return an object and that object is going to be the previous state and the detailed

03:08.770 --> 03:16.810
state and begin her return the action the payload of this detail which is going to be in this case empty

03:17.990 --> 03:19.070
and that's it.

03:19.340 --> 03:21.590
You know if I just reload the page.

03:22.010 --> 03:24.140
We still have a slow connection.

03:25.290 --> 03:28.130
I'm going to go to forward click enter.

03:28.340 --> 03:34.540
It's going to fetch all the information and I couldn't go to Mustang right.

03:34.680 --> 03:41.840
Showing the Mustang it's a nice nice car and I go back and go to Fiesta OK.

03:41.970 --> 03:46.980
That works if I go back and I go to focus MT and then focus.

03:46.980 --> 03:47.630
So it's working.

03:47.730 --> 03:49.980
You know it's working just fine.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.670
There's a few ways to do this.

03:51.810 --> 03:59.160
I just like to use this way what you can do is just to add maybe a detail right here whenever you're

03:59.160 --> 04:06.240
fetching the information from search cars you're going to do detail and just really it just added detail.

04:06.250 --> 04:07.930
MT And this is going to work.

04:08.190 --> 04:13.680
The thing is that the problem the problem is that you always need to search for something if you just

04:13.680 --> 04:21.180
go back if you have a car and you click a Mustang it's going to show the Mustang and if you go back

04:21.750 --> 04:24.420
and then go back can maybe go to a different one.

04:24.540 --> 04:30.390
You're not searching you're not clearing clearing the detail so that when it's not going to work this

04:30.390 --> 04:31.440
case works.

04:31.680 --> 04:35.880
If you're fetching information from a different place you know.

04:36.390 --> 04:39.650
So you're fetching information whenever the app renders.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.810
OK so that's fine.

04:41.970 --> 04:45.020
If you reach this section congratulations.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.600
This is a lot of information and it's not that easy.

04:47.610 --> 04:54.330
It's hard to understand then it's easy to apply because it's always the same logic but it's kind of

04:54.330 --> 04:55.670
hard to understand.

04:55.950 --> 05:03.570
So at this point I believe that you're ready to create a project with react react and redux with no

05:03.570 --> 05:05.400
problems at all.

05:05.400 --> 05:12.260
And I encourage you to create projects on your own because it's the best practice you can get.

05:12.560 --> 05:12.980
OK.

05:12.990 --> 05:20.130
So let's go to the next sections are going to be adding a new project begin to do a new project with

05:20.190 --> 05:21.650
of course more.

05:21.680 --> 05:29.160
More like with a real life approach and not this one and not going to be adding some bonus features

05:29.310 --> 05:30.120
along the way.

05:30.270 --> 05:31.820
Maybe some a bit worse.

05:31.830 --> 05:39.340
We can use with react and read Acts like a form middleware to use with forms of a law library.

05:39.480 --> 05:45.720
We can use all forms and read X because you know updating the the state and get all the information

05:45.720 --> 05:51.170
from forms could be a pain in the butt and we have a library that's going to help us to do that.

05:51.510 --> 05:55.200
And we have a few more midwifes we can we can check out.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.510
OK so let's go to the next section.
