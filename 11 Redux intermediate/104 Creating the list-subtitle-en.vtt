WEBVTT

00:00.290 --> 00:07.080
OK since now we have access to these allies this list of cars we can make something something better

00:07.410 --> 00:10.070
if I type forward which is get the list of this.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.560
So we're going to do something else right here.

00:12.850 --> 00:19.830
And since we want to have a link for each car item so we can click the link click the car and it's going

00:19.830 --> 00:21.310
to take us to a new screen.

00:21.450 --> 00:24.760
We need to import link from re-act router.

00:24.990 --> 00:31.190
So I'm going to go right here and just let me just bring this down and I'm going to say import and we're

00:31.190 --> 00:38.420
going to bring link just like before it can say Lenk from and then just react.

00:38.500 --> 00:44.780
Router Dom Burguet Let's get now what we going to do.

00:44.780 --> 00:46.890
We're going to create something else right here.

00:47.090 --> 00:50.390
We're going to leave the current item but begin to do more things.

00:50.390 --> 00:56.960
So first we need to make this element to be a link because whenever we click it it's going to take us

00:57.210 --> 00:59.000
to that to a new section.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.440
So I'm going to send a link right next.

01:01.490 --> 01:04.510
It's going to be do or specify that two.

01:04.550 --> 01:12.980
Now the thing is that whenever we click on this we need to go to the local host dash car's dash and

01:12.980 --> 01:18.290
the I.D. of the of the car so we can have a need to use something else right here.

01:18.330 --> 01:24.980
I'm going to do this and I'm going to use curly braces since we want to just create a template string

01:24.980 --> 01:25.900
right here.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.620
I'm going to need to do batiks right.

01:28.910 --> 01:30.830
So the first one is going to be cars.

01:30.860 --> 01:32.530
It's going to be inside cars.

01:32.660 --> 01:37.880
And the second one is going to be the ID since we have access to the to the car.

01:37.880 --> 01:46.410
Id like to just do a sign and then it's going to be car dot I.D..

01:46.490 --> 01:47.590
All right that's good.

01:47.870 --> 01:52.310
Now it's the Whenever we have a list inside the map.

01:52.430 --> 01:56.000
If we don't use a key re-act is going to just let us know.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.630
Do you need to put a key.

01:57.660 --> 01:58.990
So are we going to do that right now.

01:59.000 --> 02:07.890
I'm going to say key and since we have an ID for each car I'm going to say car dot ID that's fine.

02:07.890 --> 02:08.460
So OK.

02:08.490 --> 02:14.850
So what we can have is going to be an image in the left side and then just the data of the car in the

02:14.850 --> 02:15.650
right side.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.140
So I'm going to go right here.

02:17.250 --> 02:25.140
I'm going to create a div and this div is going to have a class name of left right and then the next

02:25.140 --> 02:32.350
one is going to be again a div and you can have a class name or right makes sense class name.

02:32.430 --> 02:33.580
Right.

02:34.280 --> 02:34.610
OK.

02:34.620 --> 02:38.620
So now inside here inside the left you can have an image.

02:38.760 --> 02:47.280
Now as a resource to this section I've added an image folder just just in folder with some images for

02:47.280 --> 02:48.020
each car.

02:48.210 --> 02:54.060
So you will need to download it and you need to put it put it inside the public folder right here and

02:54.060 --> 02:56.970
then begin to make a reference to that folder right here.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.490
So OK I think we need we need an image.

02:59.570 --> 03:07.400
I'm going to say EMG and then Source equals to something and then just close the close the image symbols

03:07.410 --> 03:09.600
that right.

03:09.660 --> 03:15.930
So now here we need to put the path we need to specify the path to this to this image.

03:15.960 --> 03:22.520
So again we're going to use template strings I'm going to do it just like that to use the curly braces.

03:22.650 --> 03:23.120
OK.

03:23.370 --> 03:27.240
We're going to use biotech's and inside the back text.

03:27.270 --> 03:34.320
The image is going to be inside images then for Slash and then we need the name of the image.

03:34.350 --> 03:42.380
If I go to the DVD that Jason right here at the bottom of it right here you can see that I just added

03:42.380 --> 03:46.780
the name of the image so we can just call the image and that would be it.

03:46.790 --> 03:54.290
So I'm going to go to list of course I'm going to say car dot and then image and it's going to bring

03:54.290 --> 03:55.780
the image Breguet.

03:56.150 --> 03:59.330
OK so now inside here it closes.

03:59.450 --> 04:02.990
I'm going to go back now I'm going to bring the names.

04:03.020 --> 04:07.040
Just the model and the brand of the car so we can have something right here.

04:07.220 --> 04:09.150
So the first one is going to be kind of a title.

04:09.170 --> 04:15.370
So it's going to be in 8:04 and we can call the car and then do the model.

04:15.410 --> 04:16.530
You can do that.

04:16.910 --> 04:19.300
And then we're going to output the the brand.

04:19.490 --> 04:25.250
But it's going to be kind of a smaller so I'm going to do an H six for this and we're going to call

04:25.310 --> 04:29.010
brand brand that's fun.

04:29.180 --> 04:29.600
OK.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.180
Let's see what happens if I type Ford.

04:33.100 --> 04:33.590
OK.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.150
Now it's really ugly.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.710
We're going to get some styling right now in a minute.

04:37.910 --> 04:40.620
But you know it works.

04:41.210 --> 04:44.990
And if I click on it it's going to take us to the idea of the car.

04:44.990 --> 04:45.270
Good.

04:45.290 --> 04:47.500
So that's working right.

04:47.680 --> 04:52.180
That's some style to this because this is really really really ugly.

04:52.210 --> 04:53.730
I'm going to go to the CSX.

04:53.780 --> 05:00.020
We have the the CSSA right here inside the APS-C assassin site the source folder.

05:00.050 --> 05:03.130
And it just closed all right here.

05:03.250 --> 05:07.990
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to add some styles so we can have a car item

05:08.590 --> 05:12.600
and for each car item we're going to add some styles to it.

05:12.670 --> 05:17.440
I'm going to say this one the car is going to be display and it's going to be flexible going to make

05:17.440 --> 05:19.970
use of flex because it's really nice.

05:20.040 --> 05:26.140
You're going to have a border and the border is going to be one pixel solid.

05:26.200 --> 05:31.220
And then just light gray the way.

05:31.550 --> 05:32.920
Very good.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.460
Next thing we're going to add some margin to it.

05:35.650 --> 05:39.800
So it's going to be 10 pixels pixels.

05:39.810 --> 05:40.550
Very good.

05:40.900 --> 05:42.150
It's a very real page.

05:42.190 --> 05:43.210
Well actually we don't need it.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.310
It's injecting everything right here.

05:45.360 --> 05:49.600
So you look sort of looks good everything it's just like it should.

05:49.630 --> 05:55.210
Now we need to do something else which is just to keep out the Starling's for the left side and then

05:55.210 --> 05:56.080
the right side.

05:56.250 --> 05:56.530
OK.

05:56.530 --> 06:02.120
So I'm going to say I'm going to call this car item we have right here and it just makes some space

06:02.590 --> 06:10.030
and then just call the left the left it's going to be wood of 100 pixels just something real simple.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.710
And then inside the left you can have an image.

06:12.730 --> 06:17.030
So I'm going to select this and make a reference to the image.

06:17.140 --> 06:18.520
Very good.

06:19.370 --> 06:19.630
OK.

06:19.630 --> 06:23.660
In the width of this it's going to be the size of the container.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.290
So it's going to be 100 pixels.

06:27.390 --> 06:27.900
OK.

06:27.990 --> 06:29.090
That looks nice.

06:30.310 --> 06:33.010
OK so what else what do we have.

06:33.010 --> 06:35.250
We have to style the right side.

06:35.290 --> 06:38.330
So we're going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to call.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.880
I'm going to call this car item again.

06:40.900 --> 06:45.970
Make reference to that class and then daunts and then right.

06:46.300 --> 06:51.150
So this one is going to be a flex growth of one.

06:51.250 --> 06:56.600
And then we're going to begin at Simpang and the panning is going to be 10 pixels.

06:57.080 --> 06:57.710
Right.

06:58.180 --> 07:01.810
So what else do we have the 8:04 and the 8 6 decks.

07:02.060 --> 07:09.340
OK so we're going to make reference to that Skar item then ride and then 8:04 and we're going to share

07:09.490 --> 07:10.450
the tiles.

07:10.480 --> 07:16.260
So I'm going to call the 8:4 and then make reference to the age 6.

07:18.210 --> 07:23.280
Ok so what I want is to add a margin of zero pixels.

07:23.420 --> 07:28.770
Let's get OK let's reload the page and see what happens.

07:29.060 --> 07:31.910
If I type forward OK.

07:32.030 --> 07:32.710
That's nice.

07:32.750 --> 07:35.500
Looks nice not what I'm aiming for.

07:35.510 --> 07:39.310
Let's see why you're not getting styles.

07:39.340 --> 07:40.410
You have the Mustang.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.030
It's going to be an 84.

07:42.100 --> 07:47.750
You know you're not getting any of these titles for the 8:04.

07:48.030 --> 07:48.620
That's good.

07:48.780 --> 07:49.660
Now that's fine.

07:49.740 --> 07:56.890
You're you can live it like this now just to save time is just an for going out.

07:57.180 --> 07:58.070
There we go.

07:58.470 --> 07:59.260
So OK.

07:59.310 --> 08:04.340
So we have the list and if you click on the list we go someplace that's fine.

08:04.380 --> 08:10.560
So let's go to the next section and start creating the car detail and you know it's going to get interesting

08:10.590 --> 08:18.200
because we can and we did this already with the re-act redux just displaying a list from the redux state.

08:18.300 --> 08:24.190
But the thing is that we need to change the things a little bit whenever we go to the next section.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.340
So let's go to the next next video.

08:26.340 --> 08:30.330
The next lecture and start creating the detail of the car.
