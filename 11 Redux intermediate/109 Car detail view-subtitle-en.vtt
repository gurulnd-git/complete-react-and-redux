WEBVTT

00:01.020 --> 00:04.290
OK so now let's create the detail from this.

00:04.290 --> 00:08.600
We have the data available inside maps to proms inside the prompts.

00:08.730 --> 00:12.490
But right now we have this code from the previous version.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.850
So this one is not going work.

00:13.850 --> 00:17.630
We are calling the state of card detail and we didn't have this anymore.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.340
We have stayed the course.

00:19.470 --> 00:21.930
So we are going to need to change it to cars.

00:21.930 --> 00:22.590
Very good.

00:22.770 --> 00:25.770
And since DO went to keep the same thing.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.790
I'm going to say cars equals state cars.

00:28.890 --> 00:29.570
Very good.

00:29.910 --> 00:36.600
So now what do we need to do and with this many many times I'm going to call to a function to map over

00:36.600 --> 00:37.710
this information.

00:37.890 --> 00:42.920
So I'm going to say this and then render detail just simple as that.

00:43.450 --> 00:43.700
OK.

00:43.740 --> 00:51.350
And then this props and that cars since we have access to prompts we access cars from here.

00:51.750 --> 00:52.210
Right.

00:52.230 --> 00:56.480
I'm going to go right here and create a function to do this.

00:56.550 --> 01:00.630
I'm going to say render detail it's going to be equal to something.

01:00.780 --> 01:03.240
And then we just run the function.

01:03.300 --> 01:08.670
Now this and I go I'm going a little bit faster because we did this many times.

01:08.670 --> 01:15.330
So again since we are receiving these problems that the cars and we want to access something that calls

01:15.330 --> 01:16.910
detail right here.

01:17.130 --> 01:24.660
Again it does structure this and I'm going to call detail Burguet since we want to check and do the

01:24.660 --> 01:27.860
loop whenever a detail has information.

01:28.080 --> 01:34.900
I'm going to go and do a conditional and it's going to say if detail but Burguet.

01:34.950 --> 01:44.240
So now we need to run our map so we return we want to map over the detail and say map OK.

01:44.640 --> 01:50.610
Inside the map we can use an item for each iteration and then we just return something and I'm going

01:50.610 --> 01:52.810
to call this item whatever.

01:53.300 --> 01:53.610
OK.

01:53.640 --> 01:57.210
So we want to return some GSX some going to say return.

01:57.480 --> 02:00.540
And inside here we're going to do all the GSX.

02:00.890 --> 02:01.230
OK.

02:01.230 --> 02:06.650
I'm going to wrap everything inside a div and this div is going to have a key.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.240
And this comes from react.

02:09.390 --> 02:13.020
So I'm going to say item dot ID.

02:13.110 --> 02:15.790
OK let's get.

02:15.810 --> 02:21.210
So well right here we're going to add a class because I'm going to add some styles.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.660
Not a lot of styles.

02:22.680 --> 02:26.060
So we can keep this simple and it's going to be a class name of course.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.620
And the class name is going to be car detail.

02:30.230 --> 02:31.270
Let's get.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.440
So should be fine.

02:33.430 --> 02:35.910
Now let's bring the information to.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.370
We can have an image for this.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.540
It's going to be the main image of the car.

02:39.600 --> 02:46.020
It's going to be image source and we're going to use template strings to close it right here.

02:46.020 --> 02:55.440
We do the back ticks and the image is going to be stored in images for Slash and then item that image

02:55.560 --> 03:02.010
item that image and react always x asked us to put it now.

03:02.210 --> 03:09.500
So I'm going to put out an item that image and you can see right here that we're getting the image.

03:09.510 --> 03:14.390
I'm just going to put something OK so let's set up the data.

03:14.410 --> 03:15.800
I'm going to create new dev.

03:16.060 --> 03:17.480
That's going to be a container.

03:17.680 --> 03:21.710
I'm going to add a class name of Constans.

03:23.050 --> 03:23.420
OK.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.210
And inside the content we will add all the information about the car.

03:27.550 --> 03:29.780
So what do we have we have a model.

03:29.800 --> 03:40.110
So I'm going to say H2 too and we can call the item not item that model.

03:40.180 --> 03:41.160
Then we have the brand.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.320
So we do pretty much the same thing.

03:43.390 --> 03:53.650
It's going to be for something smaller and then car Burguet now looks ugly but it works right.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.690
So we have the car.

03:54.730 --> 03:56.980
What else we need to.

03:57.190 --> 03:59.640
I believe that we have the scription.

03:59.680 --> 04:08.000
So I'm going to add P and then item that description.

04:08.320 --> 04:13.410
I did warn of scrip churn frigate and that's it.

04:13.420 --> 04:19.070
You know something simple so we can move forward to the next section and create a project for this.

04:19.210 --> 04:25.880
So right we have the Mustang and I'm not getting the the brand because I'm using car and should be brands.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.330
That's because that's why.

04:28.410 --> 04:28.690
Right.

04:28.690 --> 04:34.080
So we get the image we get the title we get the forward and we get some text.

04:34.090 --> 04:38.870
Going to go to the CSSA And that's just some styling going to be really small.

04:38.870 --> 04:41.960
Can we go right here and I believe I have it here.

04:41.980 --> 04:46.180
I'm just going to copy and paste because I didn't add much.

04:46.180 --> 04:50.740
We have an image 100 percent just space and then the padding.

04:50.770 --> 04:53.580
Just something simple OK.

04:53.970 --> 04:58.230
So let me reload the page you know looks ugly but it works.

04:58.260 --> 05:00.030
You can do something better.

05:00.060 --> 05:00.880
Of course.

05:01.020 --> 05:06.230
So we can have the image the model the brand the text.

05:06.660 --> 05:07.440
It's good.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.640
It's working.

05:08.700 --> 05:15.510
So now we can have a problem with something and maybe file I don't tell you and you start doing your

05:15.510 --> 05:16.510
own projects.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.910
You can stumble with this palm.

05:19.080 --> 05:24.510
So I'm going to give you a name just tell us a little bit about the problem and we can fix it on the

05:24.510 --> 05:26.720
next section because it is kind of long.

05:27.070 --> 05:27.980
So OK.

05:28.790 --> 05:33.360
Let me go to the home right now in the home page.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.710
We have no information.

05:34.830 --> 05:39.500
So if I type for it we get all the list Burguet.

05:39.900 --> 05:45.580
So inside the cars we have cars and just car list and color Burguet.

05:45.840 --> 05:52.620
So if I click a Mustang it's going to go go to the reducers an update read ex-state and that is get

05:53.310 --> 05:55.990
an inside here we have the list.

05:56.190 --> 05:59.750
The detail and we have some information on the detail.

05:59.850 --> 06:02.890
Now if I go back if I just go back.

06:03.480 --> 06:08.220
It's going to give us a new object right here and we're going to have the list.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.320
Of course we're going to have a color.

06:10.310 --> 06:10.980
True.

06:11.190 --> 06:13.560
And we still don't have the detail.

06:13.590 --> 06:16.010
OK it's not leading to detail.

06:16.500 --> 06:22.940
So this is kind of a problem because what happens if I click can Fiesta for example.

06:22.980 --> 06:24.160
It's a different model.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.350
Ok not Mustang.

06:26.430 --> 06:33.150
The application is going to render the debut the component but this information this detail is going

06:33.150 --> 06:34.250
to take.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.600
It could take a few seconds a few milliseconds.

06:37.650 --> 06:39.260
Update the information.

06:39.360 --> 06:44.790
So whenever the page loads you can see a flash of Mustang and then it's going to abduct the state and

06:44.790 --> 06:46.630
then you can see if you're there right now.

06:46.680 --> 06:53.520
It's not going to happen because this application it's local and it's really really fast you know.

06:53.610 --> 06:55.580
But you can see the flash right there.

06:55.740 --> 06:59.740
If I go to focus you can see something blue cause it.

06:59.790 --> 07:00.390
Yeah.

07:00.510 --> 07:03.310
If I if I just do something else.

07:03.330 --> 07:06.590
I'm going to go to network.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.650
Let me just bring this.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.410
Just split this up.

07:10.410 --> 07:11.750
Going to go right here.

07:12.180 --> 07:14.040
Me make it a little bit bigger.

07:17.020 --> 07:26.010
Virgo Arrigo So now inside the day developer tools we have one tool that it's the throttling.

07:26.290 --> 07:30.170
What we can do we can select if it's slow or fast.

07:30.260 --> 07:33.530
So we're going to select slow and just reload the application.

07:33.530 --> 07:35.890
So this one is going to take a few seconds to load.

07:35.900 --> 07:42.440
If you notice it takes awhile it's just simulating a slow phone.

07:42.440 --> 07:50.580
For example I'm going to put maybe something else maybe a D4 because 3G is too slow for me.

07:51.050 --> 07:52.000
It's too slow.

07:55.710 --> 07:56.790
That's fast.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.130
3G that's very good.

07:59.060 --> 08:01.450
OK so let's reload everything.

08:01.610 --> 08:03.790
It's going to take a while to get there.

08:03.950 --> 08:10.660
I'm going to say Ford is going to do the request and then it's going to take some time to load the information.

08:10.820 --> 08:11.350
Right.

08:11.600 --> 08:17.820
So if I go to Mustang it's going to take some time but the state of this item is going to be empty.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.180
So we can have an empty screen.

08:20.660 --> 08:24.500
If I go back and click and Fiesta we get the Mustang and then we get here.

08:24.560 --> 08:28.010
So we have a problem there that we need to fix.

08:28.130 --> 08:30.430
And I can show you how to fix it on the next section.

08:30.560 --> 08:34.910
It's not going to be that long because they did the explaining right here in the section on the next

08:34.910 --> 08:37.430
one I'm going to tell you how to fix it.
