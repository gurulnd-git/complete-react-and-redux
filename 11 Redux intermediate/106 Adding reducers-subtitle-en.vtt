WEBVTT

00:01.490 --> 00:07.700
OK so now what you're going to do we going to try to fetch the data inside this card detail you're going

00:07.700 --> 00:08.760
to do that right now.

00:08.960 --> 00:12.380
So if you remember I had a Inside the actions.

00:12.440 --> 00:18.710
Let me just close all of this because you know it can get confusing for you and confusing for me.

00:18.710 --> 00:24.710
So I'm going to open the actions just the actions index and then the car to the car.

00:25.520 --> 00:31.370
So right here we have an action that it's going to do a request going to fetch some data from the server

00:31.640 --> 00:33.500
and then it can just cancel logging the request.

00:33.500 --> 00:39.830
This will return a promise but just to check that we are calling it did the action create are just fine.

00:39.970 --> 00:45.490
I'm going to call the component will mount and just trigger that action.

00:45.560 --> 00:50.000
Remember that whenever we use bank bind action creators we add this action.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.550
The card detail action is going to be a level inside this that prompts that card detail.

00:55.610 --> 01:04.220
So I was going to say this that prompts dot Cardy card detail and says we need an ID and we have the

01:04.220 --> 01:05.360
ID right here.

01:05.420 --> 01:08.620
I'm just going to pass the ID Breguet.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.890
So if I go to the home I go to forward.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.620
I click my stand.

01:14.740 --> 01:19.390
We get a promise my Here let me just make it bigger get a promise.

01:19.460 --> 01:21.040
It means that it's working.

01:21.370 --> 01:23.950
I'm going to delete this because we don't need it.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.840
And now what I'm going to do what we need to do is we need to know that we need to create or reduce

01:28.840 --> 01:33.490
her to take this data and update the state.

01:33.690 --> 01:34.210
OK.

01:35.750 --> 01:39.160
We're going to have a problem with this because let me show you first.

01:39.170 --> 01:41.620
Let's do it in the bad way.

01:41.780 --> 01:46.700
And after we understand the bad way to do it we can do it on a different way.

01:46.700 --> 01:47.780
We're going to change it.

01:48.120 --> 01:54.380
So OK first I'm going to go to the reducers to the car which is her right here to the let's go to the

01:54.510 --> 01:56.760
next now.

01:56.760 --> 01:57.950
So card with her.

01:58.050 --> 01:58.980
That's good.

01:59.090 --> 01:59.680
So OK.

01:59.690 --> 02:07.250
The thing is that whenever we call the producers we can switch and search for a type the type that we

02:07.250 --> 02:09.140
have inside here.

02:09.140 --> 02:10.690
It's going to be card detail.

02:10.710 --> 02:18.320
So OK I'm going to go inside the reducer and create a new case for this and this one is going to return

02:18.440 --> 02:20.280
an action that payload.

02:20.450 --> 02:20.870
Right.

02:20.870 --> 02:22.530
Same thing same code.

02:22.550 --> 02:26.200
The only thing the know difference it's going to be the type.

02:26.220 --> 02:26.710
Right.

02:26.940 --> 02:27.400
OK.

02:27.540 --> 02:28.430
Let's good.

02:28.440 --> 02:37.480
So now if I just go back reload the page I go to Ford and click on Mustang.

02:37.830 --> 02:44.790
And before that I'm going to go to the gym right here to the container to the car's container and I'm

02:44.790 --> 02:50.560
just going to cancel a lot of the state to make sure that we get one car instead of four cars.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.500
OK so I'm going to go for it.

02:54.330 --> 02:59.690
Ok we get the list of cars and right here we have an array of four carts.

02:59.870 --> 03:01.730
That's the first reducer.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.550
That one is working.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.080
If I click a Mustang OK.

03:06.180 --> 03:07.950
Going to do something else of course.

03:07.950 --> 03:14.790
And then we have a car array of one and this one should be the Mustang and it's going to be the Mustang

03:14.790 --> 03:16.080
for sure.

03:16.080 --> 03:16.620
That's good.

03:16.620 --> 03:19.260
So this means that it's working.

03:19.260 --> 03:23.690
Now if you notice you're storing everything inside cars.

03:24.390 --> 03:33.180
Inside the same key the thing is that if I go back we have the same state you know and this is the problem

03:33.600 --> 03:38.970
because we are storing all the information inside cars so whenever we search for cars we have the same

03:38.970 --> 03:40.350
one with four cars.

03:40.530 --> 03:47.250
And then we are using the same one to retrieve only one one car so that one is not going to work just

03:47.250 --> 03:47.750
fine.

03:47.970 --> 03:54.180
So one way to do it is going to be creating one reducer for all seasons.

03:54.180 --> 03:57.480
Right here we are storing everything inside cars.

03:57.480 --> 04:03.680
What we can do is create a new one but it's going to be car detail just like that.

04:04.040 --> 04:14.610
I'm going to create a new reducer that is going to be car detail car detail non-jazz and right here

04:14.650 --> 04:20.940
I can take just copy all of this and put it right here going to delete the search cars because we don't

04:20.940 --> 04:22.030
need it.

04:22.110 --> 04:24.340
And inside the car reducer are going to search.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.040
I'm going to delete the card detail.

04:26.070 --> 04:33.330
So we're going to have just two reducers one for the search cars and one for the car detail now inside

04:33.360 --> 04:42.960
here get a copy is going to go back and I'm going to say this import the car detail from and then car

04:43.080 --> 04:45.230
detail right.

04:45.450 --> 04:46.080
That's right.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.270
There's one more thing we need to do right here.

04:48.300 --> 04:54.700
Whenever we call the inside the car the component we are setting the stage right here.

04:54.810 --> 05:01.250
This one should be equal to car detail so redux is going to make this dispatch.

05:01.380 --> 05:07.230
It's going to go to the action going to fetch the information right here is going to return the card

05:07.230 --> 05:13.880
the tail is going to flow through all the reducers and it's going to find a match inside card detail.

05:14.010 --> 05:16.350
It's going to return it of course.

05:16.350 --> 05:22.650
And inside the reducer it's going to store the information inside something that calls card detail now

05:22.710 --> 05:28.980
from inside the component we have access to card detail right here because this one is equal to state

05:28.980 --> 05:30.330
card detail.

05:30.330 --> 05:35.100
So if we call the card detail we can have the information right there.

05:35.260 --> 05:41.190
It's a forward we get cards and card detail a rate of zero.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.810
And that is good right here.

05:44.800 --> 05:48.930
Right here cars for card detail it's empty.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.960
And if I click a Mustang good.

05:51.010 --> 05:56.670
We have cars array for in card detail array of one that's good.

05:56.800 --> 06:03.740
And if we go back we have all the cars because this rendering from cars and not car detail and you know

06:03.940 --> 06:05.950
it works that's fine.

06:05.950 --> 06:08.710
But there is still one problem.

06:08.860 --> 06:12.220
This is just a tiny application so this could work.

06:12.220 --> 06:19.180
The problem is that most of the time you're going to use regex for applications where you need to use

06:19.180 --> 06:23.270
applications to create applications and handle lots of data.

06:23.590 --> 06:33.280
So if you had to create one reducer and one file for each reducer that you create or just one for each

06:33.940 --> 06:39.720
you know you can have a prong it's going to be really hard to maintain it's going to be a problem.

06:39.730 --> 06:49.130
So what we advise when actually redux advise is for you to use an object OK to store it in instead of

06:49.140 --> 06:51.180
raw and re use an object.

06:51.340 --> 06:58.330
And for example if you're talking about cars use one cars and store everything related to cars inside

06:58.330 --> 06:59.180
an object.

06:59.290 --> 07:03.480
If you have users store all the information inside an object.

07:03.610 --> 07:12.820
For users if you have news whatever news store all the news inside use no one reducer for the same type

07:12.820 --> 07:14.070
of information.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.530
So this is good.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.810
This works but we're going to change it to.

07:19.950 --> 07:21.370
To use an object.

07:21.370 --> 07:25.300
Let's go to the next section and see how to fix this state.
