WEBVTT

00:01.150 --> 00:04.180
OK so we have all the dependencies we need.

00:04.180 --> 00:11.590
We have this main component we index the jazz and it's bringing the components that dush app which it's

00:11.590 --> 00:12.980
giving us hello world.

00:13.030 --> 00:14.430
Just something real simple.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.160
So what we need to do a lot of things are going to show you a chart.

00:17.210 --> 00:21.030
The chart again and we need to do a lot of set ups right now.

00:21.370 --> 00:22.680
We have a lot of components.

00:22.750 --> 00:27.460
We can have the app component which is this one inside we're going to have a new component which is

00:27.460 --> 00:34.060
going to be the header that contains the search and then we can have a different component to wrap the

00:34.270 --> 00:35.810
list of course.

00:36.010 --> 00:41.560
And whenever a user clicks on a car we can have a new component for each car for each item and whenever

00:41.560 --> 00:46.960
they click it is going to show a new one that it's going to fetch all the information of this car.

00:47.130 --> 00:51.460
Update the state and then just show show it right here to something simple.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.020
OK.

00:52.320 --> 00:57.050
So OK I'm going to go back to the project and we can to start setting this up.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.390
We're going to be using routes.

00:58.390 --> 01:03.120
So the first thing is going to be importing the rounds have router.

01:03.190 --> 01:11.550
So I'm going to say import and are going to do of this and I'm going to bring the browser router right.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.880
The second thing we need is going to be the route.

01:15.490 --> 01:21.060
And we're going to import this from re-act router.

01:21.250 --> 01:24.140
It's going to be re-act router done.

01:24.220 --> 01:25.290
That's good.

01:25.860 --> 01:26.900
Okay that's good.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.740
So now we can have two main components.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.780
One is going to be the app component.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.010
And then just IKAR detail.

01:34.050 --> 01:39.470
So I'm going to call a car right now so I'm going to create and imported it but then we're going to

01:39.610 --> 01:44.810
go and create this component just to save time and go into imported right now.

01:45.040 --> 01:52.330
So it's going to be car from components and I'm going to call this one car right now I to set up the

01:52.360 --> 01:58.150
routes for this are going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to just delete the car because

01:58.170 --> 02:03.930
the idea because we don't need it so we need to wrap the whole application inside the inside the browser

02:03.940 --> 02:04.410
router.

02:04.410 --> 02:10.850
So I'm going to say browse a router and the browser router takes one elements.

02:10.870 --> 02:13.070
If we pass more elements it's going to break.

02:13.180 --> 02:15.960
So we're going to wrap everything inside a zip.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.030
We're going to use two routes.

02:18.040 --> 02:22.020
We're going to use the home route and then the car with the with the IDs.

02:22.030 --> 02:24.250
So first I'm going to do the home.

02:24.580 --> 02:25.860
So it's going to be route.

02:26.200 --> 02:31.010
Am I going to just open it close and this one is going to be exact.

02:31.030 --> 02:33.110
I'm not going to use switch.

02:33.130 --> 02:37.810
We're going to use the path and the path for this one is going to be just for Slash.

02:38.080 --> 02:44.280
We need to pass a component and the component is going to be it's going to be at that JSC.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.730
So it's got.

02:47.130 --> 02:50.320
So the next route is going to be this one right here.

02:50.320 --> 02:56.110
Now whenever we click on an item it's going to go to this view and it's going to take an idea and idea

02:56.140 --> 03:03.280
from there from the pro-ams as an argument so we can do bring the information of this particular car.

03:03.470 --> 03:11.380
So I'm going to go right here again to say route and this one again is going to have a path and the

03:11.380 --> 03:13.960
path is going to be car.

03:14.240 --> 03:22.610
It's going to be for Slash car and then for Slash calling and we pass the id the as an argument.

03:22.840 --> 03:23.270
Right.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.120
That's good.

03:24.310 --> 03:31.040
So this one is going to use the components and the component is going to be car right.

03:31.150 --> 03:33.430
Everything looks fine.

03:33.490 --> 03:39.250
Let's go and create the car component going to go right here inside components and create a new file.

03:39.250 --> 03:43.500
This one is going to be called car door jams.

03:43.590 --> 03:44.640
Right.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.270
Let me minimize this.

03:46.330 --> 03:52.240
So this car that just real simple we need to import re-act from Briac that's just going to be a class

03:52.250 --> 03:55.390
of components we need to bring components

03:57.960 --> 04:00.140
components right.

04:00.270 --> 04:02.100
What is the next thing we need.

04:02.190 --> 04:14.040
We need to create a class so this one is going to be class car and extends component why we want to

04:14.070 --> 04:16.960
render something for now just to make sure that everything is working.

04:16.980 --> 04:22.350
So I'm going to say render and inside the render method we're going to return something.

04:22.350 --> 04:23.880
Now we will return.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.770
It's just a dip.

04:25.890 --> 04:29.720
Just something really dumb just saying.

04:30.000 --> 04:39.210
And now we need to export and then default and we export the car so we can make it available inside

04:39.270 --> 04:40.570
other components.

04:40.850 --> 04:41.810
OK that's fine.

04:41.850 --> 04:45.090
So if I say it everything should be working fine.

04:45.090 --> 04:45.780
Home.

04:45.810 --> 04:46.490
Hello.

04:46.650 --> 04:53.170
And if I go to a car for Slash car and then for that last one we get car.

04:53.310 --> 04:54.090
Let's get.

04:54.510 --> 04:55.920
So now what do we need to do on the.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.600
Bring the chart again.

04:57.600 --> 05:03.360
We need to create the first components the first component is going to beat Hetter whenever we search

05:03.360 --> 05:04.920
at the user.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.880
We're going to store this value.

05:06.900 --> 05:12.570
The keyboards inside the components state and then we get to grab that keyboard and we can pass it to

05:12.570 --> 05:15.670
this component so we can search the cars.

05:15.990 --> 05:16.360
OK.

05:16.440 --> 05:16.910
That's fine.

05:16.950 --> 05:20.390
Let's create the search components.

05:20.910 --> 05:25.450
Now the search component is going to be directly linked to redux.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.600
So we will make a container with this.

05:28.770 --> 05:36.630
So I'm going to go right here back to the project and inside containers are going to create a new file

05:36.960 --> 05:41.000
that is going to be called search makes sense.

05:41.490 --> 05:45.510
Search dogs jazz.

05:45.580 --> 05:52.630
Now again we're going to make it a class based components on going to react and component and we're

05:52.630 --> 06:02.980
going to write to class is going to be class and then search and then extents and then component right.

06:03.100 --> 06:09.910
So what we need to do we can and just render some device right now is going to say render an inside

06:09.910 --> 06:13.550
the just after the render begin to return some GSX.

06:13.570 --> 06:18.860
So its return and that open and close again to create a parent's death.

06:18.910 --> 06:23.640
Just a container and the containers can have a class.

06:23.670 --> 06:29.650
I'm going to put a class name of main search makes sense.

06:30.130 --> 06:32.160
You can put whatever you want.

06:32.220 --> 06:37.240
OK so this may search we can have a form inside the search with the input.

06:37.420 --> 06:46.990
So I'm going to say form open it close and this is going to have an input and input is going to be for

06:46.990 --> 06:51.400
now type text right.

06:51.610 --> 06:54.600
Makes sense when it closes.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.550
And now everything's fine.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.420
There's something missing.

06:58.420 --> 07:08.620
We need to export the component export default and then we say search since this is going to be linked

07:08.860 --> 07:10.360
to redux.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.380
I need to do.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.520
We need to change a lot of things right now right here.

07:14.590 --> 07:16.350
So we're going to need to do something else.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.360
I'm getting an error right here.

07:18.610 --> 07:22.280
Remember with GSX you need to follow some rules.

07:22.360 --> 07:29.100
So if you create unempowered and we don't have the closing tag it's going to break the GSX.

07:29.170 --> 07:29.490
Yeah.

07:29.590 --> 07:30.450
Really don't.

07:30.790 --> 07:31.100
OK.

07:31.120 --> 07:31.710
That's fine.

07:31.870 --> 07:35.620
So let's go to the parent component which is going to be the app component.

07:35.650 --> 07:38.620
We can include this component from the from the app.

07:38.690 --> 07:44.440
So I'm going to go back to the app and I'm going to import the components.

07:44.950 --> 07:46.900
OK let's do it from here.

07:46.900 --> 07:53.710
I'm going to go right here and I'm going to say components and begin to bring the first component so

07:53.710 --> 08:00.640
it's going to be import and then search search from.

08:00.790 --> 08:02.570
And this one is going to be inside containers.

08:02.590 --> 08:05.840
So we're going to do that for Slash containers.

08:05.890 --> 08:10.230
We go and we will go one directory up and this one is going to be called search.

08:10.530 --> 08:11.060
OK.

08:11.170 --> 08:18.530
So if I go inside app I'm just going to delete the hello I'm going to wrap everything inside the app.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.810
I'm going to add a class right here.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.840
I always like to add a class.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.370
You know you don't need to do this.

08:24.490 --> 08:25.530
It's going to be app.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.320
Now we're going to we want to bring the search component right here.

08:29.320 --> 08:34.210
So I'm going to say search since we have it available right here.

08:34.210 --> 08:35.930
We can bring it no problem.

08:35.930 --> 08:45.460
And it's a search then just for Slash them it and I'm going to go back to the home and get we get the

08:45.680 --> 08:46.650
I made a mistake right here

08:50.390 --> 08:52.830
one second.

08:52.940 --> 08:56.470
So I have a closing tag right here that it's not right.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.620
If you can see it just let me know.

09:00.940 --> 09:01.320
OK.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.790
It must be on the search right here.

09:03.790 --> 09:08.270
You know I'm not used to use the VS code a lot.

09:08.860 --> 09:11.210
I just knew with it vs code.

09:11.350 --> 09:15.330
So I still need some polish.

09:15.330 --> 09:22.030
So OK so we included the search component and it's right here available inside the app.

09:22.240 --> 09:25.510
You know this is really really ugly.

09:25.630 --> 09:29.090
So we can do some styles we can add some styles.

09:29.170 --> 09:36.110
So I'm going to go to the main index are going to go right here and I'm going to import and when going

09:36.110 --> 09:42.390
to important just to see assess and we're going to do it from here it's going to be app that says OK

09:42.550 --> 09:45.100
we don't have this file so I'm going to go and create it.

09:45.100 --> 09:50.310
Right now it's going to be in the main directory.

09:50.510 --> 09:54.550
Sorry it's going to be the source directory I mean site the source directory.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.510
I'm going to create just a file but it's going to be apps.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.090
That's yes.

09:59.230 --> 10:04.890
That's SS Raigad get that mature make sure that this is fine.

10:04.960 --> 10:11.470
You we say Dot and for Slash we get the obvious Burguet So we're going to add some styles just to make

10:11.470 --> 10:13.390
this a little bit better.

10:13.750 --> 10:21.700
So I'm going to go first at some styles for the body and the body is going to have a marching zero and

10:21.700 --> 10:28.800
then a padding of zero again you know just some basic rules we're going to use a phone family going

10:28.800 --> 10:33.650
to add in the in the next video family.

10:33.830 --> 10:38.350
Now you can you can actually outed yourself that there's no problem if you want to use a fun family

10:38.390 --> 10:39.660
just like we're botto.

10:39.850 --> 10:41.960
You can if not just doesn't matter.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.460
It's not really important.

10:43.510 --> 10:46.150
So we get to do the stylings for the search.

10:46.150 --> 10:50.140
Now the main search we added a class of the search that is going to be made search.

10:50.140 --> 10:54.800
So right here going to make reference to that main search and at some styles.

10:54.940 --> 10:58.720
So this one is going to be text align and it's going to be Center.

10:58.780 --> 11:01.580
What else are we going to do padding and padding.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.740
It's going to be of pixels.

11:03.950 --> 11:09.110
We can add a border just a border bottom.

11:09.140 --> 11:17.410
Know just to add a line at the bottom and it's going to be one pixel solid.

11:17.680 --> 11:21.560
And I don't know we going do light gray.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.140
OK.

11:23.380 --> 11:24.850
Now we're going to style the empathy.

11:24.880 --> 11:31.810
So I'm going to grab the same selector main search and then make reference to the impot this impled

11:31.960 --> 11:35.250
It's going again have fun family photo.

11:35.320 --> 11:46.180
So just going to copy and paste just to save time and what else we can add a border radius border radius

11:46.270 --> 11:48.520
and it's going to be you know 30 pixels.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.300
That sounds nice.

11:50.320 --> 11:57.250
You can add a border again and this one is going to be one big old solid and just to save time begin

11:57.250 --> 12:01.920
to say light gray OK.

12:02.300 --> 12:09.750
And the color is going to be black that's fine it's black by default but doesn't matter.

12:10.160 --> 12:10.450
OK.

12:10.490 --> 12:11.770
Well what else.

12:11.780 --> 12:13.670
What we what else we can do with this.

12:13.730 --> 12:15.180
It's really really small.

12:15.260 --> 12:21.350
So I'm going to change the font size is a font size.

12:21.880 --> 12:28.730
It's going to be 20 pixels and we can add some padding you to something real simple and then just a

12:28.940 --> 12:31.020
fun just fine.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.950
It's going to be 300.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.000
OK that's fine.

12:38.010 --> 12:41.820
So if I click on this we can have this ugly ugly focus.

12:41.820 --> 12:46.820
So I'm going to just make reference to the input again and this is the last thing we're going to do.

12:46.890 --> 12:54.300
It's going to be focus and we remove that blue outline.

12:54.350 --> 12:56.400
OK so online none.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.610
Let's get if I click it.

12:59.620 --> 13:00.680
No I'd like that's good.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.470
If I type something real nice.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.030
Botto.

13:03.160 --> 13:06.410
And it's kind of a light font right.

13:06.430 --> 13:07.920
So everything looks fine.

13:07.930 --> 13:08.680
Weird.

13:08.710 --> 13:13.170
We did the routes all the setups and we created this component.

13:13.180 --> 13:16.290
So now on the next section we're going to make the search work.
