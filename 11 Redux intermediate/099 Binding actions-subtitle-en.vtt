WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:06.820
OK so now we're going to bind in-action Creator for this for the search.

00:06.830 --> 00:11.130
Now I'm going to go right here to the index of actions.

00:11.180 --> 00:16.920
I'm going to create a new file that is going to be index that jazz just like we did before.

00:16.970 --> 00:22.380
And next that jazz Briger so I can go back to search.

00:22.520 --> 00:30.890
Now if you remember on the previous section where we were when we were covering the basics of redux

00:31.370 --> 00:37.080
we import in the importante actions just like that imported import all.

00:37.110 --> 00:40.590
And we did the just like this as actions.

00:40.730 --> 00:44.880
And then from and just the main index of actions.

00:45.320 --> 00:48.330
Well the thing is that this is not the right way to do it.

00:48.350 --> 00:50.050
We do it on a different way.

00:50.090 --> 00:51.520
Just gonna delete all this.

00:51.540 --> 00:55.030
We're going to start again with with this.

00:55.040 --> 01:02.520
So first I want to do I want to go to the to the action creators and we're going to create an action

01:03.290 --> 01:08.730
and first be just going to cancel something just to make sure that we are calling the action correctly.

01:08.900 --> 01:17.720
So I'm going to say export default export function and this one is going to be called Get cars something

01:17.720 --> 01:24.410
real simple get cars right this action creator is going to receive an argument.

01:24.410 --> 01:30.110
So whenever we triggered the section the search right here is going to call to this action and it's

01:30.110 --> 01:33.030
going to pass that this that state that.

01:33.030 --> 01:34.890
So we passed the keywords.

01:35.030 --> 01:35.370
OK.

01:35.480 --> 01:38.330
Let's get so this one who's going to receive an argument.

01:38.450 --> 01:43.620
And it's going to be keyboards of keyboards.

01:43.820 --> 01:45.070
Right.

01:45.170 --> 01:48.640
So I'm going to go right here and do a console lock for now.

01:48.640 --> 01:55.460
You're not going to do the API request because we need to use a Midwest and that section it's a bit

01:55.460 --> 02:01.610
long so I'm going to say made a request with the.

02:01.790 --> 02:03.810
And then we're going to use template strings.

02:04.010 --> 02:06.790
If you're going to make use of this keyboard is viable.

02:06.810 --> 02:07.870
We are getting.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.640
And then just say key.

02:10.640 --> 02:10.910
Right.

02:10.910 --> 02:16.870
So whenever we call this action creator you can get a console log with made a request with the.

02:16.980 --> 02:19.250
And whatever we typed right here.

02:19.700 --> 02:19.970
OK.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.490
So let's go back to the search.

02:21.710 --> 02:24.410
Let's go step by step by step on this.

02:24.590 --> 02:31.520
So the first thing we need to do or two or two use redux inside of this container we need to import

02:31.730 --> 02:34.040
connect so we can connect redux.

02:34.250 --> 02:40.530
So it's going to say import import and then we bring connect.

02:40.990 --> 02:41.620
Right.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.410
And it's going to be from.

02:43.670 --> 02:46.820
And then re-act redux.

02:47.510 --> 02:48.030
Right.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.000
That's the first step.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.570
Now we need to bring the action creator we just created and we're not going to do import all as actions.

02:56.570 --> 03:00.330
What we do is we import the actual action.

03:00.440 --> 03:05.310
So I'm going to say import I'm going to make use of this structuring right here.

03:05.540 --> 03:11.840
And the function the auction creator was called Get cars and notice that right here we are exporting

03:11.840 --> 03:12.590
this.

03:12.590 --> 03:18.200
So what we can do instead of importing all since we need one action inside of this container we're going

03:18.200 --> 03:22.940
to put get cars it's just going to bring that one and it's going to be from.

03:23.330 --> 03:28.980
And then I believe it's going to be Dab-Dab for Slash and actions.

03:29.000 --> 03:29.290
Right.

03:29.360 --> 03:29.910
That's good.

03:30.080 --> 03:34.070
So we have access to these action creator.

03:34.070 --> 03:42.940
Now if you remember on the previous section we're using to inject the props whenever we have the redux

03:42.940 --> 03:54.620
state we injected the props right here inside the container doing the map state map state to prop's

03:55.370 --> 04:04.340
remember then there's a sequel and then we just return a new a new state return and then just an object

04:04.850 --> 04:05.520
whatever.

04:05.630 --> 04:10.190
And then we will just inject this inside the prop so we can have access.

04:10.190 --> 04:17.750
The thing is that this container will not use mapped state prompts because whenever we want whenever

04:17.750 --> 04:25.370
we load this component and we just type something and call that action creator we're just going to do

04:25.370 --> 04:28.330
that which is call an action Creator.

04:28.330 --> 04:36.380
This component's It's not aware of what's happening with the weed at the state so we don't need to know

04:36.380 --> 04:37.740
about the real estate.

04:37.790 --> 04:43.520
So there's no need to use Map state to prop's because we don't use the state right here which is trigger

04:43.600 --> 04:45.710
in action and that's it.

04:45.710 --> 04:50.800
Now to trigger an action we need to do something else.

04:50.930 --> 04:58.310
And you know just like maps take the props map state to props to props.

04:58.310 --> 05:02.180
We have a different way you know right here we get the props.

05:02.180 --> 05:08.240
Now to this patch props dispatch action we need to call to you to use something else that is going to

05:08.240 --> 05:15.650
be map just like that and then dispatch to props you know make sense.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.870
Now map state prompts and map dispatch to props.

05:20.160 --> 05:20.390
OK.

05:20.410 --> 05:27.070
So I'm going to create it right now and am I'm going to say function just like we did before function

05:27.610 --> 05:33.870
and this one is going to be map and then all it's in its own income case it's going to be this patch

05:34.750 --> 05:37.950
and then two and then props.

05:38.380 --> 05:38.760
Right.

05:38.860 --> 05:42.650
So open close just like that.

05:42.670 --> 05:49.420
Now this map dispatched props is going to use an argument and it's going to be dispatch.

05:49.650 --> 05:50.040
Right.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.040
This is from redux.

05:52.090 --> 05:56.660
Now this dispatch needs something needs to return something.

05:56.660 --> 06:00.180
So I'm going to say return and what we need to return.

06:00.260 --> 06:06.290
It's something else from redux and it's going to be called bind action creators.

06:06.310 --> 06:12.280
Now this is not something that we create right here manually not a function that we ride manually but

06:12.280 --> 06:15.990
we need to call the find action creators from redux.

06:16.030 --> 06:22.060
So I'm going to go just right here at the top and we're going to import that functionality.

06:22.090 --> 06:33.210
It's going to be import and then we will we will call bind and then just action and then creators.

06:33.220 --> 06:36.840
And remember I told you redux has fancy lingo.

06:37.060 --> 06:42.290
Well you know it's redux.

06:42.500 --> 06:46.270
So it's not really redux we import it directly from readers.

06:46.580 --> 06:46.860
OK.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.210
So since we have this what are we going to do.

06:49.220 --> 06:54.740
We're going to go right here at the bottom and we're going to we're going to use this mind action creators.

06:55.060 --> 06:55.370
OK.

06:55.370 --> 06:57.350
So we called by an actual creators.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.390
And this one takes two arguments.

07:00.560 --> 07:06.560
The first one is going to be the action creator that we want to use in this case is going to be get

07:06.560 --> 07:07.080
cars.

07:07.130 --> 07:09.200
So we do get cars.

07:09.380 --> 07:10.740
That's good.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.080
Now what we want to do.

07:12.110 --> 07:15.950
The second argument it's this dispatch we have right here.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.860
You know it just it works kind of in a magic way.

07:20.000 --> 07:20.710
OK.

07:21.020 --> 07:27.470
The last thing we need to do is that whenever we just do the set up for read X instead of exporting

07:27.530 --> 07:34.560
the default components we need to export it with CONNECT so we can use reacts so we can do connect.

07:35.140 --> 07:35.560
OK.

07:35.690 --> 07:44.750
Going to open and close and what we do right here we take two arguments but then we just return the

07:45.170 --> 07:49.260
original component which is going to be search.

07:49.790 --> 07:53.570
If you remember right here we used two arguments.

07:53.570 --> 07:58.610
We use the map state two props.

07:59.060 --> 08:04.330
And then the Preuss lecture we will be used in action action.

08:04.340 --> 08:08.150
Now the thing is that we are not going to use this just like this anymore.

08:08.300 --> 08:15.920
We use the map this dispatch props so I can just copy all and put map dispatched to prop's now right

08:15.920 --> 08:16.190
here.

08:16.190 --> 08:21.530
It says map state to properest undefined it's because we are not using it because we don't need it.

08:21.530 --> 08:27.290
The thing is that you still need to provide something if not it's just going to it's going to fail.

08:27.470 --> 08:32.310
So since we are not using maps data prompts what we do we say no.

08:32.840 --> 08:33.850
And that's going to work.

08:34.690 --> 08:35.080
OK.

08:35.260 --> 08:35.840
That's fine.

08:36.070 --> 08:46.000
So in theory right here my dispatch my call to the to the to the actual creator it's ready and everything

08:46.000 --> 08:47.880
should be working just fine.

08:47.890 --> 08:54.070
Now the only thing that we need to do is to call this action creator and the main point of doing all

08:54.070 --> 09:00.090
of this is that whenever we can this action creator right here right here we can call it right here.

09:00.220 --> 09:06.130
This action creator is going to be handled by readouts directly on the previous lectures since we were

09:06.150 --> 09:12.940
using import all its actions we were triggering triggering triggering that action directly.

09:12.940 --> 09:19.240
We were doing everything manually but now whenever we call it it's going to be handled by Ouida X right

09:19.240 --> 09:20.160
here.

09:20.620 --> 09:28.870
So I'm going to go and just lot of this and we're going to just call that get cars we have right here

09:28.930 --> 09:30.560
that action creator.

09:30.560 --> 09:31.160
So OK.

09:31.180 --> 09:39.190
So since we have it available inside probs I'm going to said this that props that get cars you know

09:39.310 --> 09:44.830
we have it available in this that props get cars because we are using the match dispirit dispatched

09:44.830 --> 09:52.030
props you know with the maps that props we inject the props and right here we inject the dispatch the

09:52.030 --> 09:54.040
action creators same idea.

09:54.050 --> 10:01.030
There's the props that get cars this function this action creator takes an argument which is going to

10:01.030 --> 10:02.290
be the word.

10:02.560 --> 10:11.280
And since we have access to the keyboard right here inside the state we're going to say this that stage

10:11.670 --> 10:17.840
that keyboard right now that's fine.

10:17.850 --> 10:18.100
OK.

10:18.120 --> 10:24.800
So if I type forward and click enter up we get an error message and C.Y..

10:24.980 --> 10:25.860
That's fine that's good.

10:25.910 --> 10:29.300
And I can explain you know why right here we get the message.

10:29.300 --> 10:34.270
It says made a request or request with the Ford key.

10:34.400 --> 10:39.850
So the actual creator it's getting triggered and it's receiving the keyboard.

10:40.010 --> 10:42.230
So this is working right here.

10:42.230 --> 10:45.110
Now what we can to do we're going to return to the Creator.

10:45.500 --> 10:50.490
Do all the logic for the action creator returning the type and the payload.

10:50.540 --> 10:53.710
No but we're going to do it on the next election.

10:53.960 --> 10:57.830
But right now let's get cars is working just fine.

10:57.830 --> 11:06.140
It's being called and receiving keywords and right here we have a nice message a nice error and it's

11:06.140 --> 11:09.220
saying actions must be plane objects.

11:09.230 --> 11:11.550
OK we know that we can do that right now.

11:11.790 --> 11:19.300
As I say use custom middleware for async actions and that's why we can to use middleware.

11:19.550 --> 11:23.090
Let's go to the next section and set up the middle work for this.
