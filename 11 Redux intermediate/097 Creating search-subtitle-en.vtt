WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:05.270
OK so we're going to make the search now we can to treat all the logic for the search.

00:05.280 --> 00:10.770
So what we want to do is that whenever the user enters some information right here we want to catch

00:10.770 --> 00:15.060
that event stored this data inside the component state.

00:15.150 --> 00:20.700
The re-act component state and then we're going to grab that new state of the component and begin to

00:20.730 --> 00:24.800
pass it to redux B will trigger an action creator.

00:24.810 --> 00:29.290
You're not going to do it on section but in need we need to do a lot of setup first.

00:29.310 --> 00:29.620
OK.

00:29.650 --> 00:36.310
So the first thing we need to do is we can use the state we need the constructor in this class.

00:36.390 --> 00:43.350
So I'm going to say constructor is open close and then just opening close again and we need to call

00:43.350 --> 00:47.340
the super right super right.

00:47.340 --> 00:52.540
This this one is going to just take an take an argument arguments it's going to be prompts and then

00:52.640 --> 00:55.530
on the Super we pass prompts.

00:55.600 --> 00:56.070
Right.

00:56.410 --> 00:57.840
So we can create a state.

00:57.940 --> 01:03.430
So I'm going to say this that state and then equals to an object.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.750
The the one would again begin to use right now is going to be keyboard.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.640
No because it makes sense.

01:09.640 --> 01:10.380
Keyboard.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.140
Right.

01:11.410 --> 01:16.450
And this is going to be equal and whenever the application starts it's going to be just an empty stage

01:16.450 --> 01:18.910
is the default state it's going to be empty.

01:18.940 --> 01:19.630
Let's get.

01:19.630 --> 01:25.960
So now we need to do the set up right here inside the forum so we can catch the event of the user entering

01:25.960 --> 01:27.100
new information.

01:27.100 --> 01:33.640
So I'm going to go right here ball the input on the input and we're going to create an on change listener

01:34.000 --> 01:35.480
with this you know.

01:35.890 --> 01:37.070
So this should be easy.

01:37.070 --> 01:38.910
Are you going to say this.

01:38.910 --> 01:45.010
I mean I'm going to call to a function that is going to be it's going to be called handle and then change.

01:45.070 --> 01:46.140
All right that's good.

01:46.450 --> 01:52.680
I'm going to go right here at the top just before the render and I'm going to create this function.

01:52.870 --> 01:58.670
Now this handle change is going to take an event and it's going to set in you state with the with a

01:58.690 --> 02:00.440
target value of that event.

02:00.610 --> 02:02.820
So OK I'm going to say handle change.

02:02.930 --> 02:10.330
This is going to be equal to a fad arrow function and we a pass and events.

02:10.640 --> 02:15.040
OK so since we want to grab this event we want to update the state.

02:15.040 --> 02:20.320
This is going to be this that set the state and then open and close.

02:20.410 --> 02:26.240
And inside here we pass an object the one we want to call we want to update it's going to be the keyword.

02:26.290 --> 02:31.720
So we say keyword the information we have available on the inside event.

02:31.870 --> 02:38.560
So I'm going to say event Dadds target dot value right.

02:38.680 --> 02:42.920
I'm going fast in this because we did it like two or three times already.

02:43.270 --> 02:44.440
OK that's fine.

02:44.680 --> 02:50.770
So I'm going to just do the component amount just to get the state right now.

02:50.780 --> 02:55.360
We can use it to do more set up right now but then this one is going to be useful.

02:55.850 --> 02:56.350
OK.

02:56.620 --> 03:00.040
So what do we need to do now.

03:00.280 --> 03:07.960
This right here since we can enter we are we are entering the information inside the input directly.

03:08.020 --> 03:09.750
It's not a control component.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.450
It's an uncontrolled component.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.970
So we're going to make it a control component you know.

03:14.230 --> 03:24.100
So I'm going to save value and this value is going to be equal to this dot state DOT and keyboard.

03:24.610 --> 03:25.490
Right.

03:25.540 --> 03:27.580
And it just do the word wrap.

03:27.730 --> 03:28.220
OK.

03:28.510 --> 03:29.770
So everything looks nice.

03:29.950 --> 03:35.910
So if I just died it's entering the information this is entered by re-act state.

03:35.940 --> 03:36.700
Good.

03:36.730 --> 03:38.380
Now what else do we need.

03:38.680 --> 03:45.300
Whenever the user just enters a brand for example let's say for it and they just submit the form and

03:45.300 --> 03:46.790
we need to grab this form.

03:46.810 --> 03:53.080
Stop the behavior of just refreshing the page and trigger an action creator.

03:53.090 --> 03:58.700
So OK so what we can do we can catch the unsafe event of this form.

03:58.820 --> 04:06.010
So I'm going to say on and then submit and this Ansermet is going to be equal to a function that is

04:06.010 --> 04:06.960
going to be this.

04:07.150 --> 04:12.110
And then just search cars whatever.

04:12.410 --> 04:13.790
So I'm going to copy this.

04:13.870 --> 04:19.090
This function is going to go right here on top of the handle change and we will create the logic for

04:19.090 --> 04:20.920
this search cars.

04:21.100 --> 04:21.540
Right.

04:21.760 --> 04:28.300
So I'm going to say this function is going to be equal and it's going to take an argument which is going

04:28.300 --> 04:32.490
to be the event and then just fat or a function.

04:32.710 --> 04:34.380
Ok that's fine.

04:34.390 --> 04:41.380
Now we can pass the event and what we need to do if you come from javascript from S-5 we need to do

04:41.380 --> 04:42.600
the preven default.

04:42.610 --> 04:50.490
So I'm just going to copy of this copy the event the access the event and then just prevent default

04:53.950 --> 04:59.800
OK that's fine since I want to get the state right here I'm just going to do a console log just to make

04:59.800 --> 05:02.940
sure that we are getting the right keywords.

05:03.400 --> 05:08.850
So I'm going to say this dot state OK.

05:08.910 --> 05:14.100
So I just really load the page I'm going to go to the console right now.

05:14.100 --> 05:14.790
There you go.

05:14.820 --> 05:17.160
When you make it bigger There you go.

05:17.230 --> 05:24.780
So I'm going to say for any if type answer we get keyboard that we get the state of D-Ward and forward.

05:25.050 --> 05:31.350
So now what we can do we can bring right here the top everything that it's related to read.

05:31.530 --> 05:39.120
And whenever we get this keyboard right here whenever we search the car with dispatch an action to read

05:39.120 --> 05:46.020
X and read X is going to go to the database find an entry with the Fort and just return the information.

05:46.110 --> 05:46.600
Let's get.

05:46.690 --> 05:52.980
OK let's go to the next section and just create a natural creator and first we're going to do all the

05:52.980 --> 05:53.960
set up for redux.

05:53.970 --> 06:00.230
We need to go to the app sorry the next domain index and bring all the settings for Weet-Bix.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.400
Let's go to the next section.
