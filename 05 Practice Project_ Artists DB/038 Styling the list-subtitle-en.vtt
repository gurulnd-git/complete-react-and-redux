00:00.590 --> 00:03.980
OK so let's add some styles to this list.

00:04.010 --> 00:07.830
I'm going to go right here and make reference to that that element.

00:07.940 --> 00:14.320
So it's going to be artist artists that underscore list.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.190
Right.

00:15.560 --> 00:25.880
So now this is going to be have a box sizing of borderer box and we get it added padding to it because

00:25.910 --> 00:33.360
you know we need padding 10 pixels and then 30 pixels right.

00:33.400 --> 00:33.700
OK.

00:33.730 --> 00:36.050
We're going to convert kind of a center everything.

00:36.100 --> 00:42.780
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and add the at a class for styling for each item.

00:42.790 --> 00:51.420
So I'm going to say artist list the artist and then item I believe we call that artist item.

00:51.450 --> 00:55.650
So just that check right here.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.110
We have artist item.

00:57.130 --> 00:57.990
There we go.

00:58.420 --> 00:59.080
So OK.

00:59.110 --> 01:06.040
So what I'm going to do I'm going to make this play block because it's a link I want to give a fixed

01:06.040 --> 01:13.660
hide of 290 pixels or some like then I can send a background size and you know it's kind of looking

01:13.660 --> 01:14.640
right now.

01:15.220 --> 01:15.560
OK.

01:15.610 --> 01:21.330
So we want to give a background and then just a size micron size of cover.

01:21.430 --> 01:23.870
And we're going to make it important.

01:24.420 --> 01:25.070
Right.

01:25.330 --> 01:36.100
So we're going to add margin bottom of tiny pixels and then position relative relative.

01:36.100 --> 01:36.980
Pretty good.

01:37.390 --> 01:42.520
I'm making it relative because we can float the name of the artist right here.

01:42.850 --> 01:45.000
So OK so now let's do that.

01:45.010 --> 01:47.100
Let's float the name of the artist.

01:47.120 --> 01:54.310
I'm going to make a call again to artist list to make reference to that and then Dev and just open and

01:54.310 --> 01:55.240
close.

01:55.420 --> 02:03.280
So the background for this tag is going to be background and it's going to be again just a nice blue

02:03.760 --> 02:11.400
2 1 9 6 3 Durgo looks nice.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.870
So OK we're going to have a color and color.

02:13.890 --> 02:18.390
It's going to be white and we want to make it position.

02:18.390 --> 02:19.700
Absolute.

02:20.550 --> 02:27.820
And then we want to put it right at the bottom of the elements so we can say bottom zero.

02:28.590 --> 02:30.760
And you know that looks better.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.830
So now we're going to add the padding to it.

02:32.850 --> 02:37.500
So it's going to be back pedaling 20 pixels too much.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.660
Let's give it 10.

02:40.910 --> 02:41.760
OK let's get.

02:41.760 --> 02:49.720
So the last thing we need to do is to style the brows the artist that won it with once H for Figes.

02:49.910 --> 02:50.150
OK.

02:50.190 --> 02:51.450
It's in 8:4.

02:51.510 --> 02:53.990
So OK I'm going to go right here at the bottom.

02:54.030 --> 03:00.170
Just make a reference to the item to the artist list and style that for.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.160
OK.

03:01.350 --> 03:10.620
So we're going to add some text line that's good text a line and it's going to be center and font size

03:11.700 --> 03:17.000
font size and font size is going to be 30 pixels than a font weight

03:19.890 --> 03:22.140
and the font weight is going to be 100.

03:22.170 --> 03:25.950
So something real slim and then we to add a margin.

03:25.950 --> 03:29.440
So it looks really really nice.

03:29.460 --> 03:35.050
I am a developer but sometimes I like to design apps.

03:35.210 --> 03:37.860
Now it's fun.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.220
OK.

03:38.220 --> 03:40.180
So this looks nice.

03:40.320 --> 03:44.610
So whenever we click on an artist it's going to take us to a new component.

03:44.610 --> 03:47.780
And of course this component it's not ready yet.

03:47.970 --> 03:52.340
So we're going to go to the next section and make this component ready.
