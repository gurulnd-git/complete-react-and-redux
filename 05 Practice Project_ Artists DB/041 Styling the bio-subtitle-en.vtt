00:01.020 --> 00:04.490
OK so let's add some style of this because it's really really ugly.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.030
Kind of makes no sense.

00:06.210 --> 00:10.540
So we're going to style first to Hetter so I'm going to go right here and put the letter.

00:11.050 --> 00:11.800
OK.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.490
Now I'm going to make.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.050
I'm going to just make reference to that tack.

00:16.170 --> 00:17.440
It's going to be better.

00:17.820 --> 00:20.090
And then we just have some style.

00:20.190 --> 00:21.500
I'm going to use a different font.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.700
So it's going to be font family.

00:23.790 --> 00:29.740
And then we will add more on it on there are good.

00:30.410 --> 00:30.800
That's good.

00:30.810 --> 00:36.190
And remember that you can get the section from could have everything all the section it's about styles.

00:36.250 --> 00:40.060
So if you want to skip it I probably just copy the code and just paste it.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.340
No no problem.

00:41.340 --> 00:43.610
So it's going to be text align.

00:44.190 --> 00:46.900
And the next line is going to be Center.

00:47.050 --> 00:47.980
That's good.

00:48.440 --> 00:52.230
It's going to center and you can add a phone size I'm going to make it bigger.

00:52.330 --> 00:54.390
So it's going to be font size.

00:54.510 --> 00:57.220
And then just thirty three pixels.

00:57.830 --> 00:58.470
OK.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.670
We want to split everything up.

01:00.720 --> 01:11.320
So it's going to have a border bottom of one pixel solid and then just that that nice nice blue.

01:11.520 --> 01:15.910
It's done 1 2 1 9 6 3 go.

01:16.380 --> 01:21.240
So we want to change the background to the color of the logo.

01:21.360 --> 01:26.640
So we're going to use something 9 4 9 4 9 4.

01:26.670 --> 01:35.730
It's kind of a gray color that so up close at 0 0.

01:35.820 --> 01:39.430
They're going to do that OK.

01:39.450 --> 01:40.710
So it looks nice.

01:40.710 --> 01:42.350
I kind of really like it.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.300
So you're done with it.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.630
Are you going to add some styles to the artist Viola.

01:47.670 --> 01:50.540
So I'm going to make a reference right here to this.

01:50.580 --> 01:58.820
So we're going to make reference to the artist by a class going to go Dot artist then underscore bio.

01:59.370 --> 02:09.030
And this one is going to have a box sizing of borderer box and that just padding of 10 pixels from the

02:09.030 --> 02:09.680
sides.

02:09.750 --> 02:16.140
I'm sorry from the top and bottom and 30 from the sides so we can kind of center everything that looks

02:16.140 --> 02:16.980
nicer.

02:17.490 --> 02:19.740
So we're going to style this fan.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.140
This fan is the one that contains the Avatar.

02:23.160 --> 02:32.770
It's going to say artist bio dad Avatar Avatar Dadds spam.

02:33.090 --> 02:33.720
Not spam.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.550
It's it's a it's an element not a class.

02:36.850 --> 02:38.740
So get inside the span.

02:38.790 --> 02:43.830
What we do we're going to add with of 130 pixels something like that.

02:43.830 --> 02:48.680
And then just the height height of the same thing.

02:48.690 --> 02:54.260
So we can make an MC round square you know stuttering.

02:54.450 --> 03:02.700

03:07.310 --> 03:08.660
So everything is center.

03:08.660 --> 03:09.310
That's good.

03:09.380 --> 03:15.110
And we're going to just set the background something the backroom size so we can content we can make

03:15.110 --> 03:18.150
it make everything to cover that elements.

03:18.200 --> 03:31.010
So we're going to say background and then just size and they cover of course we do important Lego looks

03:31.010 --> 03:31.710
nice.

03:32.090 --> 03:35.450
So now let's start style the H-3 three.

03:35.660 --> 03:41.740
It's going to be artist than bio and H-3.

03:41.750 --> 03:42.440
All right.

03:42.800 --> 03:52.530
So going to make it a little bit bigger it's going to be fawn's than waif and we're going to make it

03:52.570 --> 03:56.990

03:59.830 --> 04:00.630
and really like it.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.340

04:01.660 --> 04:07.180
I feel really confident this size and then we're going to make it a little bit bigger.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.170
Pixels.

04:08.340 --> 04:15.280
MARGARET And we're going to add some margin just to split everything up from bottom and top from top

04:15.280 --> 04:18.390
and bottom and then zero pixels from side.

04:18.940 --> 04:19.850
Yeah looks nice.

04:19.900 --> 04:20.860
I really like it.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.760
It could be a designer you know.

04:23.070 --> 04:23.340

04:23.350 --> 04:31.350
So we say artists video and then just bio.
