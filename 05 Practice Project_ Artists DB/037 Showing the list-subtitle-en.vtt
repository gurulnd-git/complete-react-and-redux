WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:08.640
OK so in the previous section we just made a request to an API and get the list to get the list of artists

00:08.970 --> 00:13.260
and then once we get the list we're passing the list as props.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.420
We can make this better.

00:14.430 --> 00:20.950
I'm just going to delete this an ad for Slash right here and right here again to this again and just

00:21.030 --> 00:22.050
add for Slash.

00:22.070 --> 00:24.080
You know just to make it better.

00:24.510 --> 00:29.210
So now we are passing to this child component the artists list.

00:29.210 --> 00:34.620
We're passing a prop with all the list of the artists with the artists list.

00:34.800 --> 00:41.640
So inside here inside this component we can grab whatever it's coming right here as prompts and map

00:41.730 --> 00:44.020
over and so we can show a list.

00:44.170 --> 00:44.430
Right.

00:44.430 --> 00:47.010
So we going to do that right now.

00:47.010 --> 00:52.410
The first thing that we can do whenever we get the list I'm going to go right here to the final project.

00:52.680 --> 00:56.180
Kind of a broken reset.

00:56.280 --> 01:04.370
So OK whenever we anyways whenever we get the list and I click inside of an item we go to a new round.

01:04.410 --> 01:07.040
So pretty much it's pretty much a link.

01:07.260 --> 01:09.850
So OK we need to use links.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.780
So to use links we import link from re-act router.

01:13.950 --> 01:19.970
So I'm going to say import and then just structure and bring a link.

01:20.390 --> 01:30.490
It's going to be from and then re-act router Dom frigate OK.

01:30.520 --> 01:36.330
So now what we need to do we need to grab this prompts and trigger a function.

01:36.340 --> 01:42.040
But first we're going to do some We're going to write some elements so this one is going to be shown

01:42.100 --> 01:50.580
inside a container and the class name of the container is going to be the artist list of Perl artists.

01:50.830 --> 01:52.830
And then just list.

01:53.440 --> 02:00.460
Now we're going to have a title and the title it's going to be an 8 4 8 4 and it's going to be browse

02:02.170 --> 02:05.390
the artists that I go.

02:05.740 --> 02:09.630
Now what we want to do right here we want to display the list.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.760
So what are we going to do.

02:10.780 --> 02:17.080
Can it trigger a function and we can get past the prompts as an argument so we can grab the list of

02:17.080 --> 02:21.340
users from there and just remove the console prompts.

02:21.340 --> 02:28.300
Now I'm going to just open and close curly braces and my function is going to be called list just just

02:28.300 --> 02:29.620
list.

02:29.620 --> 02:32.640
You can put whatever name you want and what are we going to do.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.140
We can pass prompts.

02:34.300 --> 02:39.940
So whenever we are rendering this list we get a graph of that part of the prompts and pass it right

02:39.940 --> 02:40.900
here.

02:40.900 --> 02:45.700
So I'm going to go right here and don't worry about the message we're going to create a function that

02:45.700 --> 02:47.150
is going to be called List.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.450
OK.

02:48.700 --> 02:54.770
Sorry Konst list just of our will and this one is going to host a function.

02:54.840 --> 02:55.190
OK.

02:55.210 --> 02:59.170
We just open and close and we create a fat or a function.

02:59.170 --> 03:00.080
There you go.

03:00.610 --> 03:05.340
So now whenever we trigger this function we are passing props.

03:05.350 --> 03:13.120
The thing is that if I go right here and cancel all the prompts when the do is just do it like that.

03:13.120 --> 03:20.350
If I cancel out the props again and just inspect props and we get an object right here with all the

03:20.350 --> 03:21.100
artists.

03:21.100 --> 03:28.900
So now if we want to just map over it we're going to have to do props Dadds all artists.

03:28.900 --> 03:34.190
So you know we can skip the props we can make use of E-6 destructor.

03:34.360 --> 03:39.540
So if we do this we are going to directly access to all artists.

03:39.670 --> 03:42.060
So I'm going to say all.

03:42.070 --> 03:45.460
And then artists.

03:45.700 --> 03:46.970
Right.

03:47.050 --> 03:50.800
So now I'm going to go here and start a map.

03:50.800 --> 03:57.190
So I'm going to say first I'm going to say we turn now what we want to return is a map it's whatever

03:57.190 --> 04:00.150
we're getting from the map of all artists.

04:00.150 --> 04:06.320
So I going to make reference to all artists that map and we're going to open and close.

04:06.580 --> 04:13.600
This one is going to use a function and then just a fad or a function just open and close.

04:13.610 --> 04:15.030
Is it an anonymous function.

04:15.430 --> 04:15.770
OK.

04:15.770 --> 04:21.220
So on each iteration I'm going to pass an item and now what are you going to do.

04:21.240 --> 04:32.920
Going to just return some data going to return a different just simple def you know item because I'm

04:32.920 --> 04:36.160
going somewhere I'm going to show I want to show you something right here.

04:36.400 --> 04:42.500
Now all artists that map it's not a function we're just triggering this.

04:42.610 --> 04:48.880
But the thing is that all artists the first time that the application loads it's going to be empty.

04:49.090 --> 04:53.590
And we can now we cannot map over an empty object.

04:53.620 --> 04:55.580
We can't do that is going to give you an error.

04:55.810 --> 05:01.510
So we need to do something else to check if all artists have has some data.

05:01.750 --> 05:08.320
So what we do is just we create a conditional and we're going to just wrap everything inside a conditional

05:10.340 --> 05:20.760
it now what we want to check if if is if all artists has data if it has We're going to render some deps

05:20.820 --> 05:25.130
right here we should be rendering for deps may just remove the console.

05:25.260 --> 05:28.680
OK we get four items one for each artist.

05:28.710 --> 05:30.040
So it's working.

05:30.720 --> 05:35.720
So let me just remove this and start doing the start putting the elements.

05:36.060 --> 05:42.840
OK so now the thing is that whenever we have an artist we want to get kind of a background image for

05:42.840 --> 05:44.100
the artist.

05:44.370 --> 05:47.030
So we want to use background.

05:47.050 --> 05:51.580
We're going to set a dev and we're going to put a background image for that gap.

05:51.630 --> 05:52.270
That's fine.

05:52.500 --> 05:58.430
So let's go back to the our project and right here instead of making our deaf.

05:58.620 --> 06:00.120
We're going to make a link.

06:00.180 --> 06:02.870
Just going to create a link for this.

06:02.890 --> 06:12.110
OK so I'm going to go right here and the link has to have an item key item.

06:12.110 --> 06:16.200
So on the database on the adjacent database I just gave you.

06:16.460 --> 06:20.760
Each artist has an ID so we can use that as a key.

06:20.790 --> 06:27.000
Remember that re-act asks ask you to pood an ID always ID.

06:27.260 --> 06:30.130
So I'm going to say item that Id Breguet.

06:30.610 --> 06:31.140
OK.

06:31.280 --> 06:39.560
So this link is going to just put a link to a place you know whenever we click an artist is going to

06:39.860 --> 06:46.620
take us to the local hosta for Slash artists for Slash and the ID of the artists.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.130
So we need to specify too.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.480
That's why we are getting this error message.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.360
So going to open and close call basis.

06:53.840 --> 06:58.790
And what I'm going to do I'm going to use template template strings going to do back text and I'm just

06:58.790 --> 07:02.070
going to put it all together right here.

07:02.240 --> 07:06.420
It's going to be for Shlash artists artist.

07:06.440 --> 07:12.400
It's just Singler for Slash and it's going to be begin to take the item ID.

07:12.470 --> 07:16.940
So you're going to say item that ID that's good.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.960
That should be clearly the message get.

07:19.970 --> 07:20.390
That's right.

07:20.390 --> 07:22.800
So we are on the good track.

07:23.230 --> 07:28.080
I'm going to add a class to this to this component to this link.

07:28.310 --> 07:37.650
So I'm going to say class name and the class name is going to be what you'd be calling artist item.

07:37.680 --> 07:45.320
There you go now each link it's Dev is going to have a background image.

07:45.480 --> 07:50.670
If I do it right here right here the tag is going to be kind of long.

07:50.730 --> 07:58.470
So what I'm going to do inside the upside of that which I'm sorry right here I get it just created a

07:58.470 --> 08:02.900
viral to host the style of this element.

08:03.210 --> 08:05.100
So it's going to have a background

08:08.250 --> 08:11.330
and the background is going to have a u r l.

08:11.610 --> 08:13.730
So we're going to do again Templer strengths.

08:13.890 --> 08:20.130
And then you are Elle and this one equals two images.

08:20.910 --> 08:24.050
Sorry it's for flash images.

08:24.330 --> 08:28.040
That's the location and the location is going to be covers.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.470
That's right.

08:29.670 --> 08:30.630
Then for Slash.

08:30.810 --> 08:37.260
And what we need to do is to put the name of the image again just right here on the D-B.

08:37.450 --> 08:38.290
Jason.

08:38.610 --> 08:46.000
Each artist whoever has a cover right here cover it's just the name of the artist in lowercase and with

08:46.120 --> 08:48.820
the symbol right there.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.520
So what we're going to do.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.710
We're going to go right here.

08:51.960 --> 09:00.030
We're going to make reference to the item that cover the dollar sign opening close and then item that

09:00.030 --> 09:00.930
cover.

09:01.380 --> 09:01.950
OK.

09:02.250 --> 09:06.270
Since all the images are going to be AJP gee I'm going to say J.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.580
P. G.

09:07.590 --> 09:08.680
Right.

09:09.550 --> 09:10.050
OK.

09:10.080 --> 09:14.270
So we're going to add one more thing to this.

09:14.730 --> 09:18.000
I'm going to say no let me make it there.

09:18.060 --> 09:18.880
No.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.600
Repeat Raggatt.

09:22.620 --> 09:30.070
So now we want we want to do we want to grab this background this style and put it inside here.

09:30.130 --> 09:38.790
So I'm going to say style equals two and then we just make reference to this verbal styles.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.880
Let's get to just go right here.

09:42.050 --> 09:46.600
Create a div and begin to put the name of the artist right here.

09:46.880 --> 09:52.700
So I'm going to say open it close and then item that name.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.540
And if we reload the page we get the item that name right.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.010
So we get some styles on the next section.

10:00.140 --> 10:02.710
And right now everything looks nice.

10:02.720 --> 10:09.320
We have all the artists and now we need to just add the styles for this so we can just make it look

10:09.380 --> 10:10.390
like this.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.910
All right let's go to the next section.

10:12.050 --> 10:18.770
And remember you can just you can go to the get have and get the CSSA for this.

10:18.770 --> 10:24.020
There is no need for you to go to the next section and type the whole see SS Just like with it on the

10:24.020 --> 10:25.250
previous lectures.

10:25.330 --> 10:26.940
You know just to save time.

10:26.990 --> 10:30.180
This course is about we react and that's the process.

10:30.290 --> 10:33.460
But I always like to show you what are going to do.

10:33.740 --> 10:35.280
Everything is going to be in close.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.990
I assume with some comments right here.

10:38.150 --> 10:42.870
So it's going to be I believe it's going to be something like artists lists or something like that.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.420
So you can just look for it.

10:44.470 --> 10:46.130
Look for that and just copy it.

10:46.360 --> 10:46.580
OK.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.240
Let's go to the next section and style the list.
