WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:08.590
OK so now everything is running at mine it's running on local host three thousand one you can be using

00:08.590 --> 00:13.570
the three thousand but I'm using the 3000 for the final application.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.650
So this is where it would be going to be building.

00:15.700 --> 00:21.190
So we can have pretty much one component which is going to be the main entry of the app and whenever

00:21.190 --> 00:28.420
we click and an artist is going to take us to an index or just an a detailed page of the artist so we

00:28.420 --> 00:30.890
can have just two views right here.

00:30.910 --> 00:31.560
We have a route.

00:31.570 --> 00:34.250
So we need to use re-act Browder.

00:34.510 --> 00:35.330
OK that's fine.

00:35.350 --> 00:42.140
Let's start doing the first start doing the set up for this since we can have two components.

00:42.220 --> 00:50.170
First we're going to create a new folder that is going to be it's going to host all the components components.

00:50.460 --> 00:54.010
We're going to have a home component and then artist components.

00:54.080 --> 01:00.090
So I'm going to go right ahead and just create a home components going to go home dungeons then begin

01:00.110 --> 01:06.200
to have you file and then artist that jazz.

01:06.670 --> 01:10.460
Now I'm going to go to the index and we need to do a lot of set up right here.

01:10.660 --> 01:20.170
So we need to import some things are going to import re-act then from react.

01:20.170 --> 01:23.300
That's the first thing we need to import re-act arms.

01:23.320 --> 01:34.470
Going to say import re re-act DONG DONG from and then just act dumb.

01:34.770 --> 01:35.740
It.

01:35.980 --> 01:37.290
Now we're going to be using routes.

01:37.310 --> 01:40.780
So we need to import browser router and route.

01:40.810 --> 01:48.490
So I'm going to say you begin to use and make use of this structuring and we can bring browser and then

01:48.520 --> 01:49.800
router.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.080
And then we need to import route.

01:53.860 --> 02:04.630
But this one is going to be imported from Briac road or Dohm react router dom dom and you know I'm just

02:04.630 --> 02:09.080
typing all this information because I want to show you how to do it.

02:09.100 --> 02:15.800
And so you can type it at home but at the end in real life you can have just a snippet to do this.

02:15.820 --> 02:20.620
Now if you're just going to collect something and it's going to create a component drive for you where

02:20.680 --> 02:21.900
you're going to have templates.

02:22.210 --> 02:22.700
So OK.

02:22.720 --> 02:29.570
So right from the start we need to set the routes with two main components the home and the artists.

02:29.590 --> 02:32.290
So I'm going to go and just create the components right here.

02:32.360 --> 02:39.360
I say components and I'm going to I'm going to import home from.

02:39.520 --> 02:44.940
And then we say Dad for Slash components for Slash home.

02:45.120 --> 02:45.940
Right.

02:46.040 --> 02:55.810
I'm going to say then import and then artist from dad for Slash components and same thing artists.

02:56.170 --> 02:56.980
Right.

02:56.980 --> 03:01.050
So this application is going to have a main entry point.

03:01.330 --> 03:06.550
I can do this directly and we're going to do it on the next sections and the next lessons.

03:06.730 --> 03:11.220
But for now I'm just going to create statelets for component.

03:11.230 --> 03:16.410
It's going to be Konst app and this one is going to be equal to pretty much nothing.

03:16.450 --> 03:18.550
And then we just run a function.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.810
This app is going to return something.

03:22.180 --> 03:26.260
And what is going to return is going to return the browser router.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.090
It can contain all the routes right here.

03:29.290 --> 03:34.090
So I'm going to say browser router and we're going to create a container.

03:34.090 --> 03:40.130
Remember that Brossel router needs to have only one element inside.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.560
So I'm going to go right here and create the routes.

03:43.780 --> 03:52.470
So I'm going to say the first route of not router route and then we'll just self-closing the first route.

03:52.570 --> 03:57.060
It's going to have a path and the path one for this one is going to be home.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.850
So it's just for Slash.

03:59.140 --> 04:04.100
Whenever we load home we get to use our components and the components.

04:04.180 --> 04:06.850
It's going to be home.

04:06.850 --> 04:07.720
Right.

04:07.810 --> 04:14.930
So since we don't want to mess with this route we want to put it to us to set it except.

04:15.150 --> 04:15.580
Right.

04:15.760 --> 04:21.010
So the next round is going to be the artist.

04:21.010 --> 04:26.510
So I'm going to say again path and this one is kind of a little bit special.

04:26.530 --> 04:35.300
We need to go to artist artist and then whenever we go to artist and I'm going right here to the to

04:35.320 --> 04:40.880
the finished her application if I click and Jimi Hendrix is going to take us to a new view with artists

04:40.910 --> 04:44.160
for Slash and the ID of the musician.

04:44.390 --> 04:47.780
So we need to use programs right here.

04:47.930 --> 04:49.470
So I'm going to do.

04:49.550 --> 04:54.390
CONAN And the name for this one is going to be artist ID.

04:54.470 --> 04:55.610
You can put whatever you want.

04:55.610 --> 04:56.410
Doesn't matter.

04:56.690 --> 05:02.360
So whenever we go to this kind of route you want to load a component and the component is going to be

05:02.420 --> 05:09.200
an artist write art it's component right here right here.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.380
So now we need to create the surrender for this.

05:12.440 --> 05:19.010
It's going to fail because this Pats This components are empty so we're going to need to do is to do

05:19.010 --> 05:20.170
something right here.

05:20.510 --> 05:31.670
So OK I'm going to go and say re-act Dom datt render and the render method takes two arguments the watts

05:31.760 --> 05:32.690
and the where.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.540
So the watch is going to be the app we create around here.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.590
That's the main entry point.

05:38.660 --> 05:43.550
So I'm going to say app and then silf close and see where it's going to be rude.

05:43.610 --> 05:46.980
The root of the H HVM l documents.

05:47.020 --> 05:57.700
So I'm going to say document and then get elements my ID and just open and close and begin to say root.

05:57.740 --> 05:58.320
All right.

05:58.490 --> 06:02.950
If I go to the original application we're going to get a lot of error messages.

06:03.140 --> 06:07.250
Everything should be tried whenever you type everything by hand.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.750
You can make a lot of typos.

06:08.810 --> 06:10.520
So it's good to have templates.

06:10.820 --> 06:11.310
So OK.

06:11.330 --> 06:18.590
We begin to go to home and we can create just a simple component just to make sure that everything should

06:18.590 --> 06:20.070
be working fine.

06:20.180 --> 06:24.720
MS they react and I go into the structure components.

06:24.820 --> 06:33.470
I get to go right here at the bottom create a class of home and this home is going to extends and components

06:34.860 --> 06:35.300
right.

06:35.300 --> 06:39.500
This one is just going to return some text I'm going to return some dummy text.

06:39.710 --> 06:41.030
So it's going to be render.

06:41.300 --> 06:50.540
And then just open and close and we can return some def just a dummy div that's going to say home.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.020
OK.

06:52.370 --> 06:57.990
Now we need to export this so it can be available outside this jast.

06:58.040 --> 07:02.660
So it's going to be support default and then home.

07:03.100 --> 07:03.650
That's good.

07:03.710 --> 07:05.380
So we get home.

07:05.510 --> 07:09.860
If you go to an internal page we are going to get an error message but right now we're not going to

07:09.860 --> 07:10.480
go there.

07:10.490 --> 07:15.700
So everything it's working fine you know is going to index is showing the text.

07:15.710 --> 07:21.560
Let's go to the next lecture and we're going to start with the main banner of the application to build

07:21.650 --> 07:24.110
this and then fetching the artist's.
