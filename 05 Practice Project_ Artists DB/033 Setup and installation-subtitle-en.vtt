WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:06.050
Do now you're going to get to do a tiny tiny project so we can practice with react.

00:06.090 --> 00:09.390
And this is the first project of all the projects that we can do.

00:09.390 --> 00:12.720
We're going to do three projects this one is going to be real simple.

00:12.720 --> 00:16.830
The next one is going to hit the real life with react.

00:16.830 --> 00:21.440
And at the end we get to do one large application with react and redux.

00:21.450 --> 00:23.310
So that's the plan.

00:23.310 --> 00:25.210
So I'll get the final result.

00:25.230 --> 00:27.670
It's going to be this one whatever the page loads.

00:27.670 --> 00:33.030
We can have just a banner with the logo and you can have a list of artists.

00:33.030 --> 00:38.250
This list is going to come is going to come from a database from a fake database.

00:38.250 --> 00:41.280
I got to tell you about that in a minute.

00:41.280 --> 00:45.890
So we clicked the artist and it's going to take us to a new Pew new component.

00:45.900 --> 00:52.230
We're going to have the image and the name description and the related Alvin's And of course if we go

00:52.230 --> 00:54.330
back it's going to go back home.

00:54.330 --> 00:56.280
So we have to use for now.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.700
Now we going to make use of Jason's server.

00:59.700 --> 01:05.380
If you don't know Jason server it's an awesome awesome application.

01:05.400 --> 01:11.080
What's the application that we can install to make a fake API.

01:11.490 --> 01:14.340
So I'm going to tell you how to solve it how to use it.

01:14.340 --> 01:21.120
Don't worry about pretty much the ideas that we install it and it's going to create a rest at API right

01:21.120 --> 01:26.810
here inside inside of our project and we can make network calls to that.

01:27.090 --> 01:31.140
And this is fake of course this is just for developing just for testing.

01:31.140 --> 01:35.910
It's not to use is not for real life use it is not for production.

01:36.220 --> 01:36.540
OK.

01:36.600 --> 01:43.450
So the first step is going to be installing making installing a new batch with create re-act app.

01:43.530 --> 01:51.430
I did that and I've deleted everything and left the index non-jazz and inside the public folder I've

01:52.080 --> 01:54.330
just left the index that HVM out.

01:54.330 --> 01:58.570
I'm going to give you a resource image folder with images.

01:58.590 --> 02:01.440
It's going to be all the albums and the covers and everything else.

02:01.740 --> 02:05.920
So you just download it and put it inside the images.

02:06.300 --> 02:06.660
OK.

02:06.680 --> 02:13.350
So to use the fake API we need to install Jason's server.

02:13.390 --> 02:18.370
It's going to go to the terminal can it open the terminal window closes.

02:18.450 --> 02:21.940
So to install it first we need to solve it globally.

02:22.130 --> 02:25.030
We can we can do it just for this instance.

02:25.080 --> 02:32.040
It's always good to have it globally because we can use it a lot so I'm going to say NPM install and

02:32.040 --> 02:33.860
then begin to start we install Google.

02:33.870 --> 02:45.080
So it's minus D then space and then Jason Jason dash dash server market and we're going to do.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.040
Mine is mine a safe course.

02:47.380 --> 02:52.020
I've already having it all the way it's going to take just a minute so I'm going to pass the Tiberio

02:53.240 --> 02:53.670
OK.

02:53.670 --> 02:54.590
Everything is done.

02:54.590 --> 02:56.710
We're going to start to sever in a few seconds.

02:56.770 --> 03:02.470
But first I want to install the re-act router because you're going to use routes with this.

03:02.470 --> 03:10.420
So I'm going to go to the Bache again and again to say NPM install and then we will say re-act router

03:11.550 --> 03:17.510
Dasch Dom and we're going to use the app for that 0 0.

03:17.950 --> 03:25.320
I'm going to I'm doing this because we have router changed a lot through the years many months.

03:25.540 --> 03:27.310
So maybe the updated version.

03:27.340 --> 03:33.940
So if we install the four 00 we're going to be working on the same version if they just release a new

03:34.240 --> 03:36.990
version with a lot of differences.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.960
Can to just update the course don't worry.

03:39.220 --> 03:47.190
So we click enter and it's going to take a few seconds and I'll just be right back OK so now everything

03:47.190 --> 03:47.980
is ready.

03:48.090 --> 03:54.210
So I'm going to open a new shell and I'm going to start the Jason server to start it when we need to

03:54.210 --> 04:00.800
do is we may need to say Jason server and it's going to be minus minus.

04:00.850 --> 04:03.410
Watch this space.

04:03.570 --> 04:10.050
And now what we need to do we need to set a reference where this database this Jason database is going

04:10.050 --> 04:14.900
to be I give you so we source along with the images a DVD that Jason.

04:14.940 --> 04:20.310
So you need to put this file on the root directory just right there.

04:20.430 --> 04:23.790
And inside this DVD on Jason we just have adjacent Jason File.

04:23.790 --> 04:24.670
All right.

04:24.750 --> 04:31.590
Just that and right here we're going to say Jason's server minus minus watch and we make reference to

04:31.590 --> 04:35.200
that file so it's going to be divi dot Jaison.

04:36.390 --> 04:41.140
Right now the next thing is going to be to select the port where it's going to be running.

04:41.250 --> 04:49.710
So we're going to do minus minus port and then I'm going to use the 3 0 0 4 for this one is the default

04:49.710 --> 04:52.260
one for the adjacent server.

04:52.290 --> 04:53.820
So just going to click enter.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.460
And if we have no problem should be there.

04:56.630 --> 04:56.990
OK.

04:57.030 --> 05:02.640
And it's ready now whenever it's done is going to say loading either Jason done and it's going to give

05:02.640 --> 05:04.050
you resources.

05:04.080 --> 05:11.700
Now if I copy this and just go to the to a new tab and just paste it right there is going to give you

05:11.790 --> 05:13.490
the adjacent file we have.

05:13.620 --> 05:20.640
So we can make a network call to this local host 3.00 for our artist and we can do it we can do operations

05:20.640 --> 05:24.640
with this database you just like a real API.

05:24.660 --> 05:29.790
So that's that's the first thing I'm going to go back to the to the to the main show.

05:30.150 --> 05:33.540
And I'm going to do NPM start.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.070
Nothing is going to happen because we don't have any files yet.

05:37.110 --> 05:38.820
I'm just going to started right now.

05:39.100 --> 05:39.390
OK.

05:39.390 --> 05:45.720
So let's go to the next section and we will start building the index the main index of this application.
