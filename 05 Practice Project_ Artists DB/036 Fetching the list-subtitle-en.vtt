WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:03.610
OK so let's start building the list of artists.

00:03.690 --> 00:06.860
Now this list could be a different component.

00:07.080 --> 00:13.110
And again it's just going to receive some data begin to fetch the list of artists from the API.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.260
Right here in the home component.

00:15.420 --> 00:19.690
And we can pass the list of artists to that child components.

00:19.920 --> 00:23.610
So that component could be a functional component.

00:23.640 --> 00:30.040
Now whenever we fetched information we want to set it into the state so we can pass it as props.

00:30.270 --> 00:36.270
So I'm going to go right here at the top and I'm going to start a constructor we're going to say constructor

00:38.590 --> 00:39.360
constructor.

00:39.370 --> 00:40.260
There you go.

00:40.660 --> 00:46.960
And then open and close and begin to use super you know so we can use this state and we're going to

00:46.960 --> 00:48.630
be passing props.

00:48.790 --> 00:53.750
Right now we're going to make a request to you Earl.

00:53.840 --> 00:58.770
We're going to begin to have all the artists if you remember the Ural.

00:58.810 --> 01:01.990
I'm going to go to you right here to the terminal.

01:01.990 --> 01:08.220
If you go to the second powerful the list is going to be stored in local host three thousand in my case.

01:08.410 --> 01:09.310
And then artists.

01:09.400 --> 01:14.260
So I'm just going to copy all of those close the terminal and I'm going to create a viral that is going

01:14.260 --> 01:16.240
to host this Eurail.

01:16.490 --> 01:16.880
OK.

01:16.900 --> 01:18.040
So I'm going to go right here.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.960
Say Konst and then you are all artists.

01:23.780 --> 01:24.860
And to make it plural.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.320
OK.

01:27.070 --> 01:28.340
I'm going to paste it right here.

01:28.430 --> 01:33.000
So whenever we call this viral we're going to make a fetch to this URL.

01:33.130 --> 01:33.640
OK.

01:33.980 --> 01:34.950
So now we can.

01:34.980 --> 01:38.470
After we do the fetch we can store everything in the state.

01:38.480 --> 01:44.010
So I'm just going to create a state it's going to be this this data state.

01:44.010 --> 01:50.510
He calls to an object and we're going to create a key right here and it's going to be artists

01:53.220 --> 01:53.830
there you go.

01:54.040 --> 02:01.330
And at first when the application LOTES this artist state is going to be empty you can just add information

02:01.750 --> 02:04.720
after everything renders OK that's fine.

02:05.020 --> 02:06.570
So everything looks good.

02:06.850 --> 02:09.100
Let's go to the project to the components.

02:09.180 --> 02:14.290
I create a Vanner I'm sorry an artist list component for this.

02:14.420 --> 02:16.240
And to create a new file.

02:16.290 --> 02:24.130
It's going to be artists list that makes sense right.

02:24.180 --> 02:29.200
I'm going to go to the artist list and I'm just going to create some component for this one.

02:29.220 --> 02:35.110
Just meant that Nicklaus's begin to import re-act from Briac just going to copy this and paste it right

02:35.110 --> 02:35.720
here.

02:35.790 --> 02:37.840
This is going to be a stateless component.

02:37.870 --> 02:41.970
We don't need to bring components just like that just bring react.

02:42.400 --> 02:48.820
And now we're going to start creating Konst and we create an artist list.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.740
Let's make it plural list.

02:51.750 --> 02:53.880
This is equal to something.

02:54.220 --> 02:56.660
And then we just open and close.

02:56.680 --> 02:57.050
OK.

02:57.110 --> 02:57.850
That's good.

02:58.030 --> 03:04.190
So now this list is going to receive some data from home and we're going to do it in a minute.

03:04.300 --> 03:08.820
I'm going to put the argument right here and we can just pass some prompts.

03:09.010 --> 03:13.100
Now whenever we receive prompts we're going to render the list.

03:13.100 --> 03:17.730
So right here just to just we're just saying I'm going to say cancel that log.

03:17.890 --> 03:25.870
And then prompts right to make sure that are getting the information correctly and I going to make this

03:25.870 --> 03:30.560
of this component available and other components.

03:30.700 --> 03:39.180
So I'm going to say export the default default and then artists list.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.150
There we go.

03:40.690 --> 03:42.940
I'm going to go right here at the top.

03:42.940 --> 03:45.730
And what we need to do we need to import that.

03:45.970 --> 03:52.040
So I'm going to say import and then it's going to be artists list.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.070
Let me just copy from here.

03:55.090 --> 03:57.210
There we go and it's going to be from.

03:57.470 --> 04:02.710
And then it's going to be a dot for Slash and then artists list.

04:02.740 --> 04:09.370
So this components it's ready to be used right here and I'm going to go right here and just make a reference

04:09.370 --> 04:11.360
to that component so we can show it.

04:11.650 --> 04:21.110
It's going to say artist list and pleural artist list and we're just going to open close.

04:21.340 --> 04:25.650
Now what we need to do and react element or no that's fine.

04:25.810 --> 04:29.240
The thing is that we're not returning anything which is doing Council lock.

04:29.720 --> 04:37.420
OK so now what we need to do we need to kind of fetch the information that we're getting right here

04:37.540 --> 04:43.690
to I'm going to go just go back and return some geas GSX so we can clear that our message because I

04:43.690 --> 04:50.580
don't really like it going to say list whatever.

04:50.710 --> 04:51.170
That's fine.

04:51.220 --> 04:52.360
So we get a list.

04:52.930 --> 04:54.330
So we're going to go to home.

04:54.850 --> 05:03.070
And what we need to do we need to fetch from the API the list of artists and whenever we get the lists

05:03.220 --> 05:09.010
the Jason the data we need to store it on the stage is set in your state for artists and then we can

05:09.010 --> 05:13.440
have passed this new state as a prop to the child components.

05:13.480 --> 05:19.350
Now whenever we just render this component the home component is going to go right here.

05:19.360 --> 05:26.390
It's going to set up the state and then it's going to render these child components these components.

05:26.650 --> 05:31.830
Then after this is rendered we're going to do the fetch for the API request.

05:32.080 --> 05:37.910
And once it's done it's going to have the days the state and it's going to render all the information.

05:38.050 --> 05:44.680
But this time we can have some artists OK let's create the app to fetch requests are going to go right

05:44.680 --> 05:51.950
here and whenever we want to trigger something after this component it's mounted.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.050
We use a lifecycle lifecycle method.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.190
They react lifecycle.

05:57.280 --> 06:04.870
So we're going to say component did mÃ¼nze you know the component will mount is the one that it's before

06:04.870 --> 06:08.650
the render and this one is the one that it's after the render.

06:08.810 --> 06:09.980
So I'm going to go right here.

06:10.050 --> 06:12.260
We're going to do a fetch right now.

06:12.520 --> 06:15.080
So what I'm going to do I can do fetch.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.490
And then we just open and close.

06:18.610 --> 06:22.320
Now the you are l is going to be stored in your artists.

06:22.390 --> 06:26.070
So I'm going to go right here and just paste it right there.

06:26.290 --> 06:28.810
Then we need to specify the method for this.

06:28.810 --> 06:36.250
So I'm going to say coma and then open and close the race is just going to make one space and then we

06:36.250 --> 06:38.090
just select the method.

06:38.380 --> 06:41.480
The method is going to be get right.

06:41.510 --> 06:43.240
Are not posting anything.

06:43.510 --> 06:50.320
Now with Fadge whenever you get the information that you're fetching you need to convert everything

06:50.560 --> 06:53.120
you need to convert the response to Jason.

06:53.120 --> 06:57.010
You need to graph the Jason from that request from that response.

06:57.160 --> 07:06.190
So I'm going to say then and then just open and close and grab the response and the response is going

07:06.190 --> 07:14.270
to be converted to Jason responds Jason and then it's a function.

07:14.290 --> 07:17.650
So we open it close parenthesis.

07:17.830 --> 07:21.190
Now after this is done we want access to them Jason.

07:21.340 --> 07:27.250
So I'm going to say Dot and then I'm going to open and close again and I'm going to grab that Jason

07:27.310 --> 07:29.150
that we just created.

07:29.170 --> 07:33.190
Now this one is going to be equal and forward.

07:33.400 --> 07:33.710
I'm sorry.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.580
It's right pointing arrow.

07:35.800 --> 07:39.730
And we can it run a function whenever we get this as a callback.

07:39.730 --> 07:45.170
So what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to console log the list of the list that we're getting

07:45.200 --> 07:46.350
the Jason.

07:46.420 --> 07:47.360
All right.

07:47.380 --> 07:57.000
So if I just go to the consul and check right here on the on the console log you know the first time

07:57.000 --> 07:59.790
that the application it's loading we're getting nothing.

07:59.790 --> 08:04.790
You know it's just doing all of the logic and returning nothing.

08:04.950 --> 08:11.060
The next time we get the data we get the it becomes a lock of the Jayson.

08:11.100 --> 08:14.050
So now we have access to that data right here.

08:14.070 --> 08:20.310
So what we need to do we need to grab this Jason and set the artist's state.

08:20.560 --> 08:26.970
So we're going to just delete this and I'm going to say this dot and what we do to said state is going

08:26.970 --> 08:29.040
to be set straight.

08:29.220 --> 08:35.460
We open it close and we just make reference of what we want to update which state we want to update

08:35.850 --> 08:41.390
since we want to update artists going to say artists that can and we can get.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.580
Jason.

08:43.230 --> 08:43.830
OK.

08:43.980 --> 08:44.690
That's good.

08:44.970 --> 08:47.810
So now you get it you're going to be going to get nothing.

08:47.820 --> 08:52.040
This empty object is going to be from artists list.

08:52.050 --> 08:53.930
We are cons. A lot of the props.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.970
The thing is that whenever we call this a component by component we are not passing any props but they're

08:59.970 --> 09:01.170
going to do it right now.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.940
I'm going to go right here and create a prop for this.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.030
Can say all.

09:05.070 --> 09:06.780
And then artists.

09:07.170 --> 09:07.640
Right.

09:07.890 --> 09:14.170
And this one is going to be equal to whatever state we have inside artists.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.920
The first time is going to be empty.

09:15.990 --> 09:19.750
But the second time you can have a state with all the artists.

09:20.100 --> 09:27.770
So going to say this doesn't state dance artists right.

09:28.410 --> 09:32.570
It's going to take a few second and look at right here inside artists list.

09:32.700 --> 09:36.210
We are passing props through all artists.

09:36.420 --> 09:42.660
So right here props when we reach this section the first time the page loads is going to be empty because

09:42.660 --> 09:43.880
we don't have any data.

09:44.010 --> 09:45.850
So the data comes empty.

09:46.140 --> 09:51.930
But the second time we get all artists an array of all the artists right.

09:51.930 --> 09:53.110
So this is working.

09:53.280 --> 10:01.710
So now what we need to do is to grab props enter all artists and create a map for this and this array

10:01.830 --> 10:04.450
so we can display the information on the screen.

10:04.710 --> 10:07.660
Let's go to the next section and just do that.
