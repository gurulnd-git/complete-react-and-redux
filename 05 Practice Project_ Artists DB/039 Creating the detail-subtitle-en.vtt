WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:04.460
OK so now we need to create the artist detail component.

00:04.590 --> 00:08.860
Right here we get an error because we don't have an actual component so we need to create it.

00:08.910 --> 00:14.340
Now if we go to the file we can have pretty much three different components.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.410
You can have a tie header on top.

00:16.410 --> 00:21.870
It's going to be a simple component that we can have the one that it says showing the detail of the

00:21.870 --> 00:27.510
artist is going to be this component and then we're going to create a new component to render components

00:27.510 --> 00:29.520
to render the album list.

00:29.820 --> 00:30.240
OK.

00:30.390 --> 00:32.140
So first we start simple.

00:32.160 --> 00:35.110
We need to import re-act from react.

00:35.200 --> 00:42.630
They're going to say import import and then we import react.

00:42.930 --> 00:48.390
And since it's going to be a class based component because you need to pass probs and handle state you're

00:48.390 --> 00:50.620
going to bring components too.

00:51.360 --> 00:51.990
Right.

00:52.290 --> 00:56.880
So we went into we went to imported from react.

00:56.880 --> 00:57.610
Right.

00:58.110 --> 00:58.820
OK.

00:59.010 --> 01:05.760
Now I'm going to create a class and this one is going to be artist artists just Singler and this one

01:05.850 --> 01:11.250
is going to extends and is going to kickstands component.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.540
Right.

01:12.630 --> 01:14.150
So we're going to go right here.

01:14.370 --> 01:24.280
I'm going to say export then default and then artists and make a default Burguet.

01:24.370 --> 01:29.090
So OK so now we need to render something so we can at least not get an error.

01:29.310 --> 01:30.560
So I'm going to go right here.

01:30.600 --> 01:38.030
And I'm going to say render that open and close and then we'll just open and close again and we can

01:38.130 --> 01:48.570
return just to you know just to clear that error message and they're going to say detail you know just

01:48.570 --> 01:50.390
to make sure that everything is working right.

01:50.430 --> 01:51.000
So it's working.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.710
We get detail get.

01:52.710 --> 01:56.730
So now we need to create a component for this header.

01:56.970 --> 02:02.910
So I'm going to go right here to the to the components and I get to create a new file that is going

02:02.910 --> 02:13.350
to be Hetter that jazz get when to go back to the artist and I'm going to import that components and

02:13.490 --> 02:14.770
said I'm going to import it.

02:14.830 --> 02:25.710
So they import then Hetter from and then it's going to be just dot for Slash and hetter because we are

02:25.710 --> 02:27.760
on the same directory.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.990
Now let's go to the header.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.370
Oh look let's do it right now.

02:32.370 --> 02:36.030
I'm going to just import this header right here.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.340
So I'm going to say.

02:37.860 --> 02:39.070
Header.

02:39.660 --> 02:45.700
And since this component's it's not going to take any kind of state or promp or whatever.

02:45.700 --> 02:48.540
We just can create a functional component for this.

02:48.780 --> 02:52.610
So let's go to the header and do pretty much the same thing.

02:52.620 --> 02:58.240
We need to import re-act from react.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.220
We're going to do this a lot of times.

03:00.230 --> 03:03.500
You know I didn't know it by memory so.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.120
OK.

03:04.350 --> 03:11.250
So we need to create a functional component so we can say Konst and begin to see whether the center

03:11.550 --> 03:15.570
is not going to take any any prompts and we just open and close.

03:15.750 --> 03:22.750
So what we are going to return is some GSX so going to say we turn now what we need to return.

03:22.770 --> 03:27.480
It's a head attack just like that.

03:29.270 --> 03:29.790
There we go.

03:29.790 --> 03:30.360
So OK.

03:30.390 --> 03:34.640
Now inside here we can have a logo whose music DVH.

03:34.740 --> 03:36.200
So we're going to use the link.

03:36.330 --> 03:40.930
So we need to import the link model from Briac router.

03:41.140 --> 03:52.920
It's going to say use destructor and say link right from and then re-act router and Dom Ferragut going

03:52.920 --> 03:59.040
to go right here at the bottom and say Link Up Link.

03:59.310 --> 04:03.360
And this one is going to be two and this one is going to take us back to home.

04:03.390 --> 04:12.020
So I'm going to say for Slash the text inside the link is going to say music DV Burguet So now we need

04:12.030 --> 04:15.540
to export this Hetter so it can be available right here.

04:15.780 --> 04:24.060
So I'm going to say right at the bottom is port default and then Hetter right.

04:24.070 --> 04:29.710
So if we go right here we get music TV we add some styles but we begin to do it.

04:29.710 --> 04:37.120
Everything on the next lecture so we can split the CSSA parts and the re-act part right so that we get

04:37.120 --> 04:37.960
the header.

04:37.960 --> 04:45.280
Now let's go back to artist and now what we need to do we need to kind of fetch the information from

04:45.280 --> 04:46.710
the ID we have right here.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.260
So the artist is going to be the number one in the database.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.750
Jason the number one is Jimi Hendrix.

04:52.840 --> 05:01.990
So we need to again grab the information from the Jason server so we can use the state because we need

05:01.990 --> 05:03.300
to pass prompts.

05:03.580 --> 05:08.950
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to start a constructor to bring the constructor and then

05:08.950 --> 05:13.030
call super just like always and you're going to be using props.

05:13.060 --> 05:16.500
I'm going to say props right.

05:16.540 --> 05:24.460
Super props props right we're going to have a state.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.920
So we're going to say this

05:29.450 --> 05:34.860
doesn't state because for now just an empty object.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.640
Now what are we going to use right here.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.140
It's going to be the data about the artist.

05:39.280 --> 05:45.130
So we're going to say artist and for now whenever the application loads whenever these component renders

05:45.490 --> 05:52.810
is going to be empty then we're going to do a fetch to the to the to the API and we can have just update

05:52.900 --> 05:54.970
the state just like we did before.

05:55.420 --> 05:55.880
OK.

05:55.930 --> 05:57.810
So what is next.

05:57.820 --> 06:00.780
We need to kind of fetch the information.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.400
So we're going to go right here and just like before we need to graph and we need to do this request

06:06.490 --> 06:16.860
after the component it's already mounted so we're going to say components did mount frigate.

06:17.010 --> 06:22.160
So after can put in the mouth that we need to fetch We need to do a fetch.

06:22.180 --> 06:22.610
Right.

06:22.730 --> 06:23.960
So they're going to say Fetch.

06:24.260 --> 06:30.100
Now we need to know that you are able to do the fetch.

06:30.100 --> 06:35.440
So I'm going to go over here the top and I'm going to create a viable that is going to contain a local

06:35.440 --> 06:38.540
hose didn't you know the of the Ural of the server.

06:38.680 --> 06:45.090
So I'm going to say Konst and then our Q4 request and then you are.

06:46.220 --> 06:51.270
Can you stem strings the back text and it's going to be h t t P.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.680
I'm just not going to type it.

06:52.690 --> 06:53.980
I have it right here.

06:54.430 --> 06:58.120
So it's going to be HTP local host 3 0 0 0.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.310
Mine is 4.

06:59.530 --> 07:01.400
And then just artists.

07:01.830 --> 07:03.050
Okay that's good.

07:03.310 --> 07:06.810
So now we need to fetch and use this request.

07:06.820 --> 07:13.570
The thing is that whenever the comput and mounted mounts and it can't just come at this we need a way

07:13.630 --> 07:17.800
to fetch the ID of the of the artists.

07:17.830 --> 07:25.750
So whenever we are working with re-act router we have access to this data inside of this that prompts

07:26.050 --> 07:28.220
match dot Priam's.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.810
So we have access to that.

07:29.830 --> 07:31.840
So I'm going into console log.

07:31.840 --> 07:43.780
And again just deaths that prompts Dadds match that permit AMS and then the ID of the of the of the

07:43.780 --> 07:44.240
pram.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.130
We gave it right here on the index.

07:46.150 --> 07:48.180
It's going to be artist ID.

07:48.230 --> 07:53.060
It's going to go back to artist and just collide right here.

07:54.470 --> 07:57.860
And going to go to the council to make sure we're getting that.

07:58.190 --> 08:00.390
So cancel and OK.

08:00.410 --> 08:01.190
We get one.

08:01.250 --> 08:07.280
So it's working but I'm going to just come this and come and fetch because we're going to use it right

08:07.280 --> 08:08.820
now.

08:08.990 --> 08:11.290
So what we need to do to fetch.

08:11.310 --> 08:17.390
We need to make call a network request to this to this location.

08:17.420 --> 08:24.950
So I'm going to use the request you are all going to go right here and start template saying it do door

08:24.960 --> 08:28.210
sign and then use the request you are out.

08:28.370 --> 08:30.020
Let's get that's the first step.

08:30.110 --> 08:34.970
Then we need to do a forced lash and we put the ID right here.

08:34.970 --> 08:35.870
It's not going to be one.

08:35.870 --> 08:40.870
We need to get it from this that prompts that match that perhaps an artist.

08:40.970 --> 08:48.110
So I'm going to go again do dollar sign up pretty close and bring that.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.300
Now we need to specify the type of request.

08:51.350 --> 08:53.730
So it's going to be method.

08:54.620 --> 08:58.620
And then just get just like we did before.

08:58.670 --> 09:04.760
And again just like we did for we need to grab the response so it's going to be then when you do it

09:04.760 --> 09:19.850
right here that then and we're going to grab the response and begin to just get the Jason is pongs that

09:19.850 --> 09:22.490
Jason just like with it precisely.

09:22.700 --> 09:27.800
And then whenever we get the response we want to grab this data and do something.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.630
So I'm going to say Dan and I are going to say Jason.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.560
And then just run a callback function.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.770
Right.

09:37.820 --> 09:44.420
So what we want to do we want to update the state of artists whenever we get this information after

09:44.420 --> 09:46.120
the component it's mounted.

09:46.340 --> 09:53.390
We want to have the state of artists and put whatever information we get from the fetch.

09:53.600 --> 10:01.040
So I'm going to say this dot said state and we open close and then we just use an object.

10:01.220 --> 10:04.860
And this one is going to be equal to artist.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.200
CONAN And Jason

10:09.220 --> 10:10.460
OK that's good.

10:10.840 --> 10:17.200
So if I go right here and do a consulate just to make sure that we are getting the data if we canceled

10:17.260 --> 10:20.730
that Jason because like Jason we should be getting it.

10:20.770 --> 10:25.410
And here we are getting Jimi Hendrix the cover bio and blah blah blah blah.

10:25.480 --> 10:25.800
OK.

10:25.840 --> 10:26.700
That's good.

10:27.040 --> 10:34.150
So now we have the state and since the information of the artist it's inside the state what we can do

10:34.450 --> 10:41.710
we can just go right here below the header and just add all the information that we need to add to display

10:41.710 --> 10:43.700
the information of the artist.

10:43.900 --> 10:46.450
Let's go to the next section and just do that.
