WEBVTT

00:00.740 --> 00:04.910
OK so the last thing we're going to do is to import the album list.

00:04.920 --> 00:09.600
We can to create a different component to render this because we need to map overhead.

00:09.650 --> 00:12.510
So it's kind of a good idea to create a new component.

00:12.710 --> 00:17.570
So I'm going to go right here to components and I'm going to create a new file and this one is going

00:17.570 --> 00:22.560
to be called a boom list non-jazz Burguet.

00:22.880 --> 00:27.790
So I'm going to close it and I'm going to go back to to the artist list to the artist.

00:28.070 --> 00:32.810
So right here I'm going to create an import we get to get an error message but just a matter of now

00:33.400 --> 00:35.330
we're going to create an import.

00:35.360 --> 00:43.130
Are we going to import this component and this one we're going to be calling it album list or something

00:43.130 --> 00:44.510
like that from.

00:44.810 --> 00:47.530
And then just dog for Slash of list.

00:47.750 --> 00:48.990
OK that's good.

00:49.010 --> 00:52.820
So I'm going to go to all list and create a component for this.

00:53.150 --> 00:53.970
So right.

00:53.990 --> 01:01.260
So the first thing we need to do is to import react from react.

01:02.180 --> 01:02.500
OK.

01:02.630 --> 01:03.490
And that's good.

01:03.500 --> 01:07.730
We're going to create just a status component.

01:07.730 --> 01:13.090
You know this album list is just going to receive props is not going to do anything else.

01:13.100 --> 01:17.180
So we don't have a state so we can create a stateless components.

01:17.390 --> 01:21.510
So we say equal and it's going to it's going to receive props.

01:21.590 --> 01:28.480
So we say props that equal to our function and then we just do the logic right here.

01:28.590 --> 01:28.870
OK.

01:28.910 --> 01:33.270
I'm just going to return some stat text so we can make sure that it's working.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.780
So we're going to say return.

01:35.390 --> 01:37.900
And we just return an empty dip.

01:38.090 --> 01:40.080
Can you say all of them.

01:40.160 --> 01:40.800
Whatever.

01:41.030 --> 01:41.590
Very good.

01:41.780 --> 01:48.890
So we're going to export this export default and we export these components.

01:48.970 --> 01:49.670
Very good.

01:49.670 --> 01:50.940
There's no need for that.

01:51.340 --> 01:51.690
OK.

01:51.710 --> 01:57.830
I'm going to go back to the artist and since we have it right here available inside this component I'm

01:57.830 --> 02:05.240
going to go right here after the vial and I'm going to just call it on the list of open the list and

02:05.240 --> 02:07.130
then close it.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.670
If we remove the page we can see the reward right there.

02:10.670 --> 02:11.860
So it's working.

02:12.270 --> 02:12.520
OK.

02:12.530 --> 02:16.480
So what do we need to do now now to render the list.

02:16.610 --> 02:21.030
This component needs to receives receive some prompts.

02:21.250 --> 02:21.760
OK.

02:21.860 --> 02:29.450
So from artist what we can do we can pass that this state that artist right here and then the album

02:29.600 --> 02:33.000
if I go to the Jason and file DVD.

02:33.010 --> 02:38.240
Jason Alban's is going to be an array of elements.

02:38.320 --> 02:44.800
So OK so I'm going to go go back to schools as in say the artist I'm going to create a problem and it's

02:44.800 --> 02:57.460
going to be album list and this one it's going to be equal to this dot state DOT artists dot dot and

02:57.550 --> 02:59.930
albums get.

02:59.950 --> 03:02.150
So whenever this is rendering it's going to pass.

03:02.150 --> 03:04.920
This prompts the list of albums.

03:05.270 --> 03:06.700
OK that's fine.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.360
This is enough for here for this component.

03:09.550 --> 03:11.890
Let's go to the to the album list.

03:12.330 --> 03:12.600
OK.

03:12.610 --> 03:18.310
So inside the album list what we want to do we want to catch the prompts and then just run a function

03:18.700 --> 03:21.190
to map over the Omelas.

03:21.310 --> 03:24.460
So I'm going to go right here to the return.

03:24.520 --> 03:30.480
Can it just delete the album and I can just add a class name so we can style this later.

03:30.910 --> 03:36.910
So this component this element is going to be called albums on this score list.

03:36.910 --> 03:37.630
Very good.

03:37.990 --> 03:44.430
So now we need to call to a function so we can map over it and my want my function is going to be shouldest

03:45.500 --> 03:50.910
the show list is going to past the props that it's receiving from the parent component.

03:51.040 --> 03:51.420
OK.

03:51.550 --> 03:57.560
Let's get they're going to go right here and create a function to map over the props.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.140
So I'm going to say shouldest.

03:59.260 --> 04:00.170
Oh sorry.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.340
Konst shouldest.

04:02.620 --> 04:06.400
This one is going to be equal to some arguments.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.770
And then just trigger function.

04:08.770 --> 04:14.680
Now whenever we pass prompts we can access the prompts and destructor everything just like with it before

04:15.040 --> 04:16.140
since.

04:16.210 --> 04:25.800
Let me just show you right now we're going to save props and we just get going to pass always the prompts.

04:25.820 --> 04:26.580
So OK.

04:26.730 --> 04:28.000
OK.

04:28.390 --> 04:29.400
Just let me show you.

04:29.400 --> 04:33.290
We have the album list and inside the album list we have an array.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.820
So what we can do instead of calling props.

04:35.980 --> 04:41.990
We can enter props you can use destructuring Antrel props and the structure with the album list.

04:42.010 --> 04:48.790
So I'm going to do curly braces and call of them list.

04:48.790 --> 04:50.480
There you go.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.060
Going to delete this.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.920
And again just like we did before.

04:53.920 --> 04:59.590
We need to render this we need to map over this other list only if it has data.

04:59.770 --> 05:04.690
And the first time that this component component renders we didn't have data it's going to be empty

05:04.780 --> 05:06.550
and it's going to give us an error message.

05:06.550 --> 05:13.360
So we need to wrap everything inside a conditional that checks if the elements this object has data

05:13.870 --> 05:16.600
can say if and then just album list.

05:17.120 --> 05:25.750
Ok so since we want to return some GSX that's inside a map I'm going to say We turn then we grab the

05:25.840 --> 05:29.870
album list and dots and we map over it.

05:29.920 --> 05:39.100
So something real simple we can to create an anonymous function and we can pass an item.

05:39.410 --> 05:41.720
OK it's going to be each album.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.000
Right.

05:42.010 --> 05:48.160
So we need to return some jazz acts so we can say return an opening close.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.740
Now what we can in return.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.220
It's just an image just an image tag.

05:52.330 --> 05:55.820
Can you just put this just an image.

05:55.840 --> 06:00.800
So I'm going to say EMG and I'm just going to close it for now.

06:00.820 --> 06:08.300
Now whenever we just loop react is going to ask us to put a key whenever we just do a map.

06:08.770 --> 06:09.040
OK.

06:09.070 --> 06:11.790
So the thing is that we just have a one.

06:11.800 --> 06:16.320
We have only one thing one when name the name of the image.

06:16.450 --> 06:24.130
What we can do whenever we just run a map we can pass as a second argument the index and the index is

06:24.130 --> 06:26.970
going to be the and the number of the iteration.

06:27.010 --> 06:31.840
So it's going to be 0 1 2 3 whatever elements you have on the list.

06:31.900 --> 06:39.450
So as we get it pass I'm going to pass the index I'm going to say just index.

06:39.670 --> 06:40.990
You can do pretty much where you want.

06:40.990 --> 06:47.360
You can add that you can put the index and then do template strings and just add the name of image.

06:47.380 --> 06:49.680
So something something like that.

06:49.720 --> 06:49.960
OK.

06:49.990 --> 06:57.640
So I'm going to say I'm not going to just put the all and say Source equals and now we need to put to

06:57.640 --> 06:59.780
put the source of the image.

07:00.530 --> 07:05.980
OK so we're going to use template strings and the saw in the image is going to be stored inside for

07:05.990 --> 07:16.670
Slash images for Slash albums for Slash and the name of the file which is going to be the the one we're

07:16.690 --> 07:24.540
getting right here on each iteration so we can access doing item d'arte cover that's name.

07:25.100 --> 07:25.760
OK.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.620
And we need to add the extension.

07:28.630 --> 07:32.030
So it's going to be JPT.

07:32.090 --> 07:35.840
So it's nice to have all the images right here.

07:35.930 --> 07:41.750
Of course we need to add some styling but everything just looks really nice.

07:41.780 --> 07:44.630
So let's go to the CSSA and Abda stifle this.

07:44.780 --> 07:46.210
And that's pretty much it.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.950
So let's go to styles.

07:48.980 --> 07:56.150
And let me just put it right here on the same container so we can see going to need to make a reference

07:56.210 --> 07:58.920
to these to this list.

07:58.950 --> 08:05.150
So OK so we're going to say all them thought of them underscore list.

08:05.150 --> 08:06.890
That's the main container.

08:06.890 --> 08:09.090
And we can add a margin of 20 pixels.

08:09.290 --> 08:17.940
We can do something with simple that because now we need to kind of float everything.

08:17.990 --> 08:24.520
So I'm going to say I'm going to make reference to them this again and then just call the after going

08:24.550 --> 08:35.450
to do the self closing the self-clearing clearing floats and say clear both then display table and then

08:35.450 --> 08:39.230
just content nothing.

08:39.230 --> 08:41.290
Now just to clear the floats.

08:41.360 --> 08:41.870
Right.

08:42.180 --> 08:43.920
So now I'm going to go right here.

08:44.330 --> 08:52.880
Make reference to them list then begin to select begin it just select its image and then we're just

08:52.880 --> 09:04.710
going to float everything to the left and everything is going to have a width of 50 percent no.

09:04.840 --> 09:05.220
OK.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.640
It seems like I made a mistake.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.200
It's not selecting the elements.

09:10.220 --> 09:14.270
Maybe I didn't put this this inside the album list.

09:14.510 --> 09:22.420
I'm going to say I did albums list so I'm going to go back to the styles and just put albums list makes

09:22.440 --> 09:23.570
sense.

09:26.190 --> 09:26.810
OK.

09:27.090 --> 09:30.530
Again we are getting the same problem albums list.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.170
No it's fine.

09:32.470 --> 09:35.280
OK let's say a diva and see what's going on.

09:36.690 --> 09:40.360
It is going to grant the elements and we get Alvin's list.

09:40.490 --> 09:45.840
We are getting the margin than oh I've just made a mistake with that.

09:45.840 --> 09:51.260
Silly me sorry with their ego OK.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.560
So it's working.

09:52.770 --> 09:55.160
Looks nice.

09:55.500 --> 10:00.140
No it's fine for the first first project for the act.

10:00.330 --> 10:01.850
You know you're doing a lot of things.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.560
You're using a lot of other components.

10:04.720 --> 10:11.440
We're using state we're mapping over over items or containers.

10:11.610 --> 10:14.870
So you know it's a lot of things now.

10:14.940 --> 10:21.170
The next sections begin to talk about more specific things about react.

10:21.480 --> 10:28.410
And after that begin to create a new new project and that one is going to be kind of long because it's

10:28.410 --> 10:31.420
a real life scenario.

10:31.740 --> 10:35.690
So OK so let's wrap this up and go to the next section.
