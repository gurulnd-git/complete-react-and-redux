WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:07.510
OK so we can it we get it and we can start creating the Verum the Vanner and we're going to need to

00:07.540 --> 00:09.260
add some styles to it.

00:09.310 --> 00:15.340
So I'm going to go right here to the public folder and I'm going to create a new folder for the CSSA

00:15.670 --> 00:19.860
so I'm going to say C S S S just like that.

00:20.020 --> 00:28.770
And it to create insights here assess a new stylesheet is going to be styles dot CSSA and I'm going

00:28.770 --> 00:35.080
to go to the index that H-2 email and let me just put this down and right here I'm going to use for

00:35.080 --> 00:37.180
this project to fonts.

00:37.210 --> 00:39.670
It's going to be monotone or something like that.

00:39.800 --> 00:43.960
And the famous rebozo are going to use that one are going to give you the link.

00:43.960 --> 00:44.590
Don't worry.

00:44.590 --> 00:49.030
If not you can go to Google fonts and get yourself or you can use a different front.

00:49.030 --> 00:50.440
It doesn't really matter.

00:50.770 --> 00:51.010
So.

00:51.010 --> 00:51.380
OK.

00:51.430 --> 00:55.320
We need to link the stylesheet that we have.

00:55.480 --> 01:03.420
So I'm going to say link and then Rayle equal equals to stylesheet.

01:03.910 --> 01:04.390
Right.

01:04.390 --> 01:05.580
That's the first thing.

01:05.590 --> 01:13.500
Now we need to add a reference so it's going to be age graph and then it's going to be inside C Ss that

01:13.530 --> 01:15.790
for Slash styles.

01:16.060 --> 01:17.510
And then that CSSA.

01:17.890 --> 01:18.430
Right.

01:18.430 --> 01:20.410
And then just close it.

01:20.430 --> 01:21.810
So this should be working fine.

01:21.810 --> 01:22.380
Looks nice.

01:22.440 --> 01:22.950
OK.

01:23.190 --> 01:28.420
So I'm going to go I'm going to just go to Home and right here.

01:28.650 --> 01:35.730
Now if we take a look to the final project this banner could be just separate a separate component and

01:35.730 --> 01:38.250
then the list could be a different component.

01:38.250 --> 01:43.670
So we're going to create two different components one for the banner and different one for the artists.

01:43.730 --> 01:49.940
I'm going to go right here and I get the inside components are going to create a component for banner

01:50.900 --> 01:53.260
banner that jazz.

01:53.550 --> 01:54.140
OK.

01:54.570 --> 01:57.260
And then one for the artist app we're going to do it later.

01:57.300 --> 01:58.070
Don't worry.

01:58.440 --> 02:06.240
So OK now inside home I want to bring this Vanner components so I'm going to go right here at the bottom

02:06.600 --> 02:15.760
and we can import Vanner from and then components.

02:16.260 --> 02:18.260
We are in the same directory.

02:18.330 --> 02:29.300
So it's going to be for Slash dot for Slash dot dot for Slash components sorry for Slash and then Vanner.

02:29.340 --> 02:30.410
There you go.

02:30.420 --> 02:37.440
So now it's always when you build and re-act application it's always a good idea to split the components

02:37.770 --> 02:43.530
if you have kind of a separated idea right here inside the component and top you create creating new

02:43.530 --> 02:45.350
components and you import it.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.790
And they use it right here.

02:46.950 --> 02:48.670
But you split everything up.

02:48.690 --> 02:55.230
If you if you inspect a different project you're going to see that they split everything up.

02:55.230 --> 02:55.800
So OK.

02:55.820 --> 02:58.740
See we want access to this Vanner right here.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.800
And this one is going to be the parent component the home.

03:02.070 --> 03:08.460
So right here are going to make reference to components going into the home and go right here the bottom.

03:08.610 --> 03:10.420
And we're going to call this Vanner.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.160
We just import it.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.870
So I'm going to say Vanner.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.110
OK let's get.

03:17.130 --> 03:21.310
So I'm going to go to the Vanner and create the same logic for this.

03:21.990 --> 03:24.260
Import react from react.

03:24.420 --> 03:29.960
And since the Vanner has no state has passed no state.

03:29.970 --> 03:36.430
And actually we could use a state list status component and not a class component.

03:36.430 --> 03:39.800
You know we don't need a state for this.

03:39.990 --> 03:46.520
So it's always a good idea that if you don't need a state you just create a functional component.

03:46.800 --> 03:51.150
So we're going to say Konst I'm going to say banner just like that.

03:51.570 --> 03:54.840
This vendor receives no prompts.

03:54.870 --> 04:02.510
So we're not going to send information or data to this Vanner So we just return some GSX.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.760
OK.

04:05.460 --> 04:06.720
There you go.

04:06.720 --> 04:11.490
So this is going to be a dev and we're going to add a class name to it.

04:11.610 --> 04:14.480
It's going to be equal to Vanner.

04:14.910 --> 04:23.220
I go inside the inventor you're going to have going to have the main cover which is the image of the

04:23.220 --> 04:23.690
girl.

04:23.800 --> 04:30.210
They're going to have class name equal to main cover.

04:30.210 --> 04:31.020
There you go.

04:31.590 --> 04:33.660
And inside you can have just a logo.

04:34.010 --> 04:35.050
It's a div.

04:35.370 --> 04:40.660
And again just class name equal to logo.

04:41.070 --> 04:41.620
Right.

04:41.730 --> 04:45.470
And the logo is going to say music DVH.

04:45.810 --> 04:52.770
Now at the bottom if you see if you see on the original project the finished project you can have like

04:52.770 --> 04:54.160
a blue line right there.

04:54.360 --> 05:00.370
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and add this pan and then we can style that span.

05:00.960 --> 05:01.490
OK.

05:01.620 --> 05:07.130
Now since we want this component to be available inside home we need to export it.

05:07.200 --> 05:18.840
So I'm going to go right here the bottom and say export default asks for default and then Vanner.

05:18.900 --> 05:21.520
So if I go to the original we get this set.

05:21.540 --> 05:22.210
This is good.

05:22.230 --> 05:25.920
It means that they are just linked and they are working.

05:25.920 --> 05:30.040
So let's go to the styles that see assess and at some styles to this.

05:30.060 --> 05:33.010
It's not going to be really really hard you know.

05:33.250 --> 05:40.980
OK so I'm going to go right here and say body and the body we can add a margin zero for the body we're

05:40.980 --> 05:44.430
going to be using a fun family for the whole project.

05:44.430 --> 05:46.020
We're going to use robo botto.

05:46.290 --> 05:48.940
So it's going to see is going to say rowboat.

05:49.930 --> 05:50.320
OK.

05:50.340 --> 06:00.860
The background of go the background is going to be a a a a not a sports.

06:01.050 --> 06:01.670
Yeah.

06:01.990 --> 06:07.860
And then they begin to add some text for the things it's just global styling.

06:08.070 --> 06:14.350
You can do text decoration and we can set it to none.

06:14.460 --> 06:19.320
And then with the color we just inherit.

06:19.320 --> 06:20.010
There we go.

06:20.280 --> 06:25.730
So let's add the styles for the for the banner going to go right here.

06:25.850 --> 06:31.390
Now I'm just going to add some comments right here so we can split everything up.

06:31.440 --> 06:35.700
I'm going to say OK first we need to make reference to the banner.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.780
So then we make reference to the main cover.

06:39.780 --> 06:40.510
There we go.

06:40.890 --> 06:43.600
So now the main cover is going to have a background.

06:43.980 --> 06:51.030
So we say background and the background is going to be you are l then open and close and the L is going

06:51.030 --> 06:54.090
to be indicted for Shlash images.

06:54.450 --> 06:59.870
And then for Slash and cover that's going to be the main image.

07:00.210 --> 07:00.920
Right.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.630
So it's going to be a height of 400 pixels.

07:03.690 --> 07:09.780
You're not going to be real specific with styles you know just to make it look good.

07:09.810 --> 07:13.970
So you're going to say background and the background is going to be Macron size.

07:14.190 --> 07:17.540
And then we get a cover so we can cover that section.

07:18.030 --> 07:25.650
We're going to say background and then position and the background position it's going to be center

07:27.090 --> 07:29.990
center and center right.

07:30.210 --> 07:34.420
The position is going to be relative relative because we need to do something else inside.

07:34.590 --> 07:36.510
So we're going to say relative.

07:36.810 --> 07:38.460
And then again now the.

07:38.490 --> 07:39.760
Now let's change the height.

07:39.810 --> 07:46.410
Let's do let's do it a little bit bigger 465.

07:46.570 --> 07:48.010
So far I reload.

07:48.230 --> 07:48.750
That's fine.

07:50.690 --> 07:51.030
OK.

07:51.090 --> 07:55.220
So now what we need to do we need to do something else.

07:55.650 --> 08:00.020
I'm going to go and specify the Vanner logo.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.280
Just going to go right here.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.920
Well you know I'm just not getting anything.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.990
We should be getting something at least.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.500
Let me just inspect this just to make sure.

08:09.620 --> 08:24.630
Get in inspect the music divi logo main cover and just I suspect that I put Van Ness in that Vanner.

08:24.830 --> 08:26.530
So we get something and that's it.

08:26.930 --> 08:35.890
Let me grab the council and we can use the simulation of an iPhone.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.000
Phone sex.

08:37.110 --> 08:42.580
And just going to put this at the bottom OK.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.420
Let's get right.

08:45.450 --> 08:46.620
So we have the banner.

08:46.620 --> 08:50.070
Now this logo need to center the logo right now.

08:50.070 --> 08:55.580
So I'm going to go right here to the styles and we get to make reference to the Vanner.

08:56.550 --> 08:59.830
And then just a dot logo.

09:00.630 --> 09:01.160
OK.

09:01.440 --> 09:08.510
So we're going to select the font family for this and the font family is going to be Minot's on.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.700
OK let's get.

09:12.900 --> 09:16.510
So we're going to have a position and the position is going to be absolute.

09:16.560 --> 09:22.200
And that's why we made the container the parent container relative so we can center everything in the

09:22.200 --> 09:23.070
middle of the screen.

09:23.250 --> 09:24.770
You're going to say top the top.

09:24.780 --> 09:26.460
It's going to be 50 percent.

09:26.460 --> 09:34.240
The left is going to be 50 percent again and then begin to use transform to center everything.

09:34.260 --> 09:46.100
Trents form right the transform you're going to use translate and then 50 percent and then 50 percent.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.070
Right.

09:48.110 --> 09:50.400
Everything is going to be kind of a center.

09:50.520 --> 09:54.020
We need to that is to specify the width for this.

09:54.360 --> 09:54.620
OK.

09:54.630 --> 09:58.950
So we're going to say width and the width is going to be 100 percent.

09:59.460 --> 10:05.370
And then we can decide to select the height and height it's going to be 62 pixels or whatever we're

10:05.370 --> 10:09.930
going to select color and the color is going to be white.

10:12.240 --> 10:21.590
And we're going to have fun size and the fun size is going to be 43 pixels and you can have a text line.

10:21.870 --> 10:23.700
And this is a line that can be center

10:26.600 --> 10:30.630
and it could have a Looks nice but there is something missing.

10:30.630 --> 10:36.590
Let me check why on second with the inspectors.

10:36.740 --> 10:41.780
So we have the main cover banner cover the logo and the logo.

10:41.780 --> 10:45.380
It's kind of a going out of Fortran.

10:45.470 --> 10:46.200
Let's see why.

10:48.330 --> 10:50.910
Because we have we made a mistake with the translator.

10:51.270 --> 10:54.180
So it's minus 50 percent.

10:54.240 --> 10:58.940
That's good a minus coma and then minus 50 percent.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.850
Let's get.

11:00.880 --> 11:05.710
So now looks nice actually looks really really nice.

11:05.740 --> 11:09.080
So let's add the blue line to this pan.

11:09.140 --> 11:21.370
I'm going to say Vanner and then expand and then we to add a display block and then a height of 20 pixels

11:21.910 --> 11:29.740
and the background we can add a background for hash tag 2 1 9 6 EF 3.

11:29.770 --> 11:32.430
It's a nice light blue.

11:33.040 --> 11:33.800
Right.

11:34.200 --> 11:34.530
OK.

11:34.570 --> 11:40.310
So if you you're bored with all this this information right here with the CSSA.

11:40.390 --> 11:41.040
Well you can do.

11:41.050 --> 11:43.530
You can go to get have to the project.

11:43.570 --> 11:49.190
We would all the files are and you just can go and copy the CSSA and skip this part.

11:49.210 --> 11:56.350
You can go right forward to the next election or when we just do this we do the do the actual react

11:56.410 --> 11:57.410
and not ss.

11:57.580 --> 12:05.240
But you know I've chosen to choose just to film those two recorders so you can see the whole process.

12:05.260 --> 12:08.880
You can go to get have a copy of this and just paste it right here.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.070
I could do the same thing.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.220
But you know could be kind of confusing.

12:12.440 --> 12:12.880
So OK.

12:12.910 --> 12:13.930
Love that's fine.

12:13.930 --> 12:20.170
The the the banner it's ready let's go to the next section and do the list the list of artists.
