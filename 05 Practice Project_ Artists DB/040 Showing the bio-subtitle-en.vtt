WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:07.140
OK since we have the information available right now in inside the state what we can do is just grab

00:07.140 --> 00:11.840
the data directly from the state since we have only one object one.

00:11.900 --> 00:17.230
When you use one musician one entry we can just loop that.

00:17.370 --> 00:23.430
I'm sorry we can just display that and not create a map for it because we have only one result then

00:23.430 --> 00:28.440
with the list it's going to be something else we're going to do a different component because we will

00:28.440 --> 00:32.060
need to loop overhead to map overhead.

00:32.420 --> 00:32.700
OK.

00:32.730 --> 00:38.700
So let's start creating the GSX for this going to go right here at the bottom.

00:38.760 --> 00:42.010
I'm going to say Dev and just open and close.

00:42.090 --> 00:48.000
Now this container is going to be is going to have a class name and the class name is going to be artist

00:48.610 --> 00:50.310
of bio.

00:50.570 --> 00:54.180
That's good sense right.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.200
So right from the start we can have an avatar.

00:57.280 --> 01:02.020
So going to create a div with a class name of Avatar it's.

01:04.190 --> 01:07.210
It my boss is kind of wearing out.

01:07.850 --> 01:12.440
I've been recording like for I know five hours maybe more.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.930
So sorry for that.

01:14.210 --> 01:15.490
You're almost done with this.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.610
I didn't want it to stop.

01:17.660 --> 01:18.240
So OK.

01:18.290 --> 01:24.430
So inside the Avatar I'm it created just a span to host the image.

01:24.820 --> 01:33.800
So on a different section on the press section right here in the home I believe it's going to be the

01:33.800 --> 01:36.890
banner that we have right here now.

01:36.950 --> 01:39.430
Now the banner just wanted to double check.

01:39.450 --> 01:44.280
Don't remember right now we have the style right here on the artist list.

01:44.330 --> 01:50.720
We created a link and then we passed the style as in just a survival.

01:50.720 --> 01:58.260
We created a construct of our will to host the image as a success and then we passed the viable.

01:58.260 --> 02:01.830
Now we're going to do a we're going to do it in a different way.

02:02.030 --> 02:05.640
I did this on purpose so I can show you two different ways.

02:05.660 --> 02:11.030
Now what we can do we can grab this data and just put this style directly in line.

02:11.270 --> 02:11.550
Right.

02:11.550 --> 02:12.320
Right from here.

02:12.350 --> 02:14.800
And not to use a variable.

02:14.960 --> 02:19.360
So I'm going to I'm going to go to Pan and I'm going to use style.

02:19.730 --> 02:21.950
Now the thing is that you might be thinking.

02:21.980 --> 02:23.950
OK so you need to add the style.

02:23.990 --> 02:27.840
So what you do is just back to X and you just add the information.

02:27.860 --> 02:35.590
Well not really we would have sex whenever we want to use CSSA in the SS and type all the properties

02:35.590 --> 02:36.400
right here.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.980
We need to use double double curly braces.

02:40.010 --> 02:40.640
Yeah.

02:40.940 --> 02:49.460
And then I'm going to do background and con and then what do we need to do then we will use the the

02:49.460 --> 02:54.140
attempted strings to just add the information about this property.

02:54.160 --> 02:54.600
OK.

02:54.860 --> 03:01.760
So this one is going to be you are all going to open and close and we're going to do a quote and it's

03:01.760 --> 03:11.030
going to be hosted inside images for Slash then covers for Slash and I'm going to just do the word wrap

03:11.570 --> 03:19.900
cars and we need to call this to this item to the name of the car.

03:20.270 --> 03:24.300
So the name of the cover is going to be inside the state.

03:24.300 --> 03:24.860
All right.

03:25.100 --> 03:36.040
So we're going to do this Dodson's state DOT and then it's going to be artist dot and then cover.

03:36.990 --> 03:37.520
OK.

03:37.910 --> 03:39.440
And then we add J.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.230
P. G.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.170
Right.

03:42.230 --> 03:44.650
You can add no repeat at the end.

03:44.660 --> 03:48.410
No repeats.

03:48.680 --> 03:54.230
Now what you can do instead of just doing that this state many times I'm just going to do it because

03:54.230 --> 03:58.520
I'm just showing you what you can do the can you host you can just save this.

03:58.520 --> 04:02.110
Does that state that artist inside of Barville.

04:02.180 --> 04:03.630
And then just call devival.

04:03.770 --> 04:04.410
You can do that.

04:04.430 --> 04:05.240
No problem.

04:05.780 --> 04:06.840
But I'm not going to do it right now.

04:06.840 --> 04:10.640
I'm just going to show you the kind of the raw way.

04:10.730 --> 04:14.430
So OK so we have this pan with a you're going to go right here.

04:14.540 --> 04:16.000
Of course we're not going to get anything.

04:16.010 --> 04:17.490
We need to style this.

04:17.720 --> 04:25.250
So first before doing this style so we can go to the next section and style this and get it at all the

04:25.250 --> 04:27.110
information are going to say class name.

04:27.320 --> 04:31.430
And this one this container is going to be for the bio.

04:32.270 --> 04:32.890
OK.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.200
So inside via we're going to have the name of the artist.

04:36.280 --> 04:45.140
So it's going to be H-3 going to open and close and it's going to be this that state that artist than

04:45.220 --> 04:47.440
that name.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.510
OK so save the page we get Jimi Hendrix.

04:50.510 --> 04:51.660
That's good.

04:51.680 --> 04:56.460
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and we can have the violin the actual text.

04:56.660 --> 05:04.400
So it's some dummy text so it's going to say depth and inside of a get out just out of class so I can

05:04.400 --> 05:07.030
make a reference and change the font style.

05:07.130 --> 05:10.410
So it's going to be bio text.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.670
Let's get we're going to make.

05:12.670 --> 05:22.990
We're going to call this dot state DOT artist and the name for this is going to be bio.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.880
Everything is going to be in the side of Jason so you can check that out.

05:25.920 --> 05:26.400
OK.

05:26.630 --> 05:27.650
So we have the bio.

05:27.710 --> 05:32.100
If I go to the application we get all the data.

05:32.180 --> 05:32.710
That's fine.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.440
So we should be working fine.

05:34.700 --> 05:41.350
Now let's go to the next section let's add some styles to the header and the and the advice.

05:41.420 --> 05:43.160
And then we will add the Alpert's.
