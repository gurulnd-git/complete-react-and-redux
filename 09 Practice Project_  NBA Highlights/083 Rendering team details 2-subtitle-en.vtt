WEBVTT

00:02.550 --> 00:08.730
OK so let's create a function to render this want to go right here at the top and before render data

00:09.090 --> 00:12.740
I'm going to create a function that is going to render this Quon.

00:12.930 --> 00:13.630
OK.

00:13.950 --> 00:16.130
So we can make it a fat zero.

00:16.200 --> 00:23.530
And then just call to pass the squat squat.

00:23.550 --> 00:24.560
Now this.

00:24.660 --> 00:28.730
This is it's going to be an array of objects.

00:29.070 --> 00:29.900
I made a mistake.

00:30.030 --> 00:34.910
I call the Reds or data is going to be called render squar good.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.960
So this is going to be an array.

00:37.010 --> 00:38.800
So we need to map over it.

00:38.960 --> 00:49.540
So I'm going to say return and then we want to map squad and then squad is going to be map and map right.

00:49.550 --> 00:56.620
So again with each map we're going to pass an item and then just run a function.

00:56.620 --> 00:59.350
We want it to return soon GSX.

00:59.840 --> 01:04.880
So we're going to create a div and return everything inside a container.

01:05.260 --> 01:07.820
So we need a key for each map.

01:07.850 --> 01:15.920
So we're going to pass the item that name could pass whatever we want in a past class name and the class

01:15.920 --> 01:26.310
name is going to be equal to item that player that wrapper.

01:26.800 --> 01:33.430
So now what we need to do we have just an image to render something you know this could be an avatar

01:33.720 --> 01:40.360
and I was going to get a lot of work to create some database and bring all the original images from

01:40.360 --> 01:41.680
the to the players.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.360
And you know there are not real players.

01:43.370 --> 01:47.160
Roberto Roboto Yeah it's not Michael Jackson Yeah.

01:47.470 --> 01:48.000
OK.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.170
So let's bring the image for that.

01:50.170 --> 01:51.800
Just a dummy image.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.240
So first we will need the image.

01:54.250 --> 02:01.110
So I'm going to say EMG and then for Slash to close it and say Allt and then opening close.

02:01.270 --> 02:08.740
Item that name we're going to bring the source so it can be source and we can use template strings to

02:08.740 --> 02:09.780
bring the source.

02:09.940 --> 02:14.560
And it's going to be stored in images for Slash Avatar.

02:14.560 --> 02:20.220
And this is going to be fixed our time that P and G.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.460
All else we need to bring the name of the player.

02:24.610 --> 02:32.090
So I'm going to say it for you to create an 84 and then inside I'm going to bring the item name.

02:32.290 --> 02:34.640
Let me check what's going on right here.

02:35.010 --> 02:35.220
OK.

02:35.230 --> 02:37.330
So we get that drunk.

02:37.370 --> 02:40.240
We have to add a lot of styles of course.

02:40.240 --> 02:43.080
Now we can have just the data.

02:43.120 --> 02:50.230
The other player you know the points for game the average per game assistance assistance per game no

02:50.400 --> 02:51.130
wherever.

02:51.460 --> 02:56.720
So we're going to just close it and going to create a container for this.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.400
No not not.

02:57.520 --> 03:06.310
I'm just going to create notes I'm going to say Dev and each div it's going to be just a node you know

03:06.310 --> 03:08.740
because we get a short clip classis.

03:08.930 --> 03:13.280
So just going to create a template of this of each node.

03:13.540 --> 03:20.380
So you get to say node and now we need to pass some attributes of the players I'm going to say spam

03:20.920 --> 03:26.980
and each attribute is going to be inside this van and this one is going to be the number and says we

03:26.980 --> 03:27.890
want the number.

03:27.910 --> 03:29.480
This is going to be in the database.

03:29.590 --> 03:38.590
So we say item that number could get a copy because it's just a template and instead of number it's

03:38.590 --> 03:45.630
going to be points per game and the points per game is going to be PBG right click Create a node create

03:45.630 --> 03:46.560
a new one.

03:46.560 --> 03:58.000
You can have assistance pre-game assists per game is a PGE if you're not a big fan of the NBA now it's

03:58.000 --> 04:02.050
just the amount of passes with scoring.

04:02.350 --> 04:06.030
Then we have a new node and it's going to be RPG.

04:06.100 --> 04:09.170
I really don't know what this is.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.200
No RPG.

04:10.210 --> 04:13.370
It's like a gun or something like that.

04:13.660 --> 04:14.400
I don't know.

04:14.410 --> 04:15.650
Not a big game or two.

04:15.940 --> 04:16.170
OK.

04:16.180 --> 04:21.580
So I'm going to go back reload the page and then we just get the data.

04:21.640 --> 04:25.400
You know it's really easy to get data inside of an array.

04:25.420 --> 04:27.120
No it's really really simple.

04:27.140 --> 04:30.800
When once you get used to it it's just copy pasting.

04:31.240 --> 04:34.500
OK so everything looks nice should be working fine.

04:34.540 --> 04:38.570
It's not because we need to add of course a lot of Starling's.

04:38.650 --> 04:44.700
So let's go to the next section of the styles for this and just call today.

04:44.860 --> 04:46.330
OK let's go to the next section.
