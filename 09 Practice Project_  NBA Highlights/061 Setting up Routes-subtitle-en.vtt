WEBVTT

00:01.840 --> 00:09.200
OK so let's start building this for the first component which is going to be the main entry of the application.

00:09.340 --> 00:14.540
So I just have the index not just that it's calling the app inside computer components.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.370
So I'm just rendering Hello world.

00:17.530 --> 00:24.160
I'm going to do NPM start so we can at least get the hello world right here and in the meantime I'm

00:24.160 --> 00:27.800
just going to just ride some things I'm going to go over here.

00:27.840 --> 00:31.880
Oh it's just something he's already I'm running running on port three thousand it's because I have the

00:32.350 --> 00:33.730
finished project right here.

00:33.850 --> 00:40.360
So I'm going to say yes and it's going to do the same thing but it's going to just run the project inside

00:40.360 --> 00:42.150
the three years you want the next.

00:42.190 --> 00:43.140
Then export.

00:43.270 --> 00:44.000
Right.

00:44.020 --> 00:48.080
So hopefully we're going to get the hello world and we do Burguet.

00:48.220 --> 00:52.380
So OK so the first thing we need to do is to create the routes for this.

00:52.390 --> 00:54.320
We're going to have just three routes.

00:54.430 --> 01:01.060
It's going to be home and then we're going to have teams and whenever we can a team is going to take

01:01.060 --> 01:02.400
us to the description.

01:02.440 --> 01:02.880
Right.

01:02.920 --> 01:03.680
That's good.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.530
So let's go back to home.

01:05.540 --> 01:07.630
So we're going to have three different routes.

01:07.810 --> 01:10.710
First we need to import routes and router and routes.

01:10.710 --> 01:18.670
So I'm going to say import than do destructuring it's going to be browser router right.

01:18.700 --> 01:26.680
That's the first thing that we need to import route and everything is going to be imported import ups

01:26.800 --> 01:27.560
from.

01:27.820 --> 01:32.220
And then just react broader dumb re-act router.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.270
Don't forget.

01:34.840 --> 01:38.890
So from the start we can have a few components.

01:38.890 --> 01:46.440
So I'm going to say components and begin to have a header right here whenever the the application loads.

01:46.570 --> 01:48.270
We have a header right here.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.140
We're going to have to have a future of course.

01:51.310 --> 01:52.600
And then we're going to have home.

01:52.690 --> 01:55.020
OK so this is the first round.

01:55.270 --> 01:58.160
So I'm going to go just right had an import.

01:58.190 --> 02:00.200
However we didn't have it yet.

02:00.280 --> 02:10.060
But anyways so we can say import Hetter from are we going to say Dot for Slash and hetter Let's get

02:11.240 --> 02:12.510
we're going to have a future.

02:12.520 --> 02:15.220
So I'm going to say import footer

02:19.240 --> 02:27.550
from and then just footer dot force lounge and footer Breguet just like a regular web page and we're

02:27.550 --> 02:35.560
going to have the home I'm going to say import home from dawn to force Nash home.

02:35.810 --> 02:40.680
Burguet So what we need to do right now is to create the rounds.

02:40.750 --> 02:46.870
So I'm going to go right here and just delete the hello world and inside the return we're going to start

02:46.870 --> 02:50.880
with browser router to open close.

02:50.880 --> 02:59.870
You can rub everything inside a div OK and inside of it start building the router for this.

02:59.870 --> 03:01.080
First we're going to have the header.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.260
Of course you're going to get an error but it doesn't matter.

03:03.260 --> 03:06.580
We're going to just add something to the header right now.

03:06.800 --> 03:10.110
So I'm going to say Hetter.

03:10.420 --> 03:11.220
All right.

03:11.330 --> 03:15.940
The next one is going to be the first route which is going to be the one that just closed.

03:16.110 --> 03:24.440
That's the first route is going to be the home so we can say route and then we can have the exact because

03:24.440 --> 03:27.420
it's going to be just home and we can do path.

03:27.620 --> 03:32.500
And this one is going to be equal to four slash the component that begin to use for home.

03:32.570 --> 03:33.380
It's going to be homes.

03:33.410 --> 03:40.370
I'm going to say component calls and then just home well there we go.

03:41.030 --> 03:41.260
OK.

03:41.270 --> 03:45.510
This is the first round we're going to have the teams roud and the and the.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.620
And then the team idea about they can begin to do it later.

03:48.830 --> 03:51.180
And just after this we can have a footer.

03:51.290 --> 03:58.590
So I'm going to say footer there we go OK.

03:58.710 --> 04:04.410
So now if I go here of course you get a nerd because we didn't have a letter and we didn't have a footer.

04:04.530 --> 04:05.210
Let's get.

04:05.280 --> 04:11.490
So let's create a header and footer right now so we can skip that our message going to go to components

04:11.770 --> 04:19.600
and I'm going to create a new file and it's going to be Hetter dot J.S. and I'm going to create a footer

04:21.150 --> 04:27.650
new file footer that has Burguet.

04:27.780 --> 04:30.620
So right from the start the header.

04:31.140 --> 04:38.970
Well we don't need unity state inside the header so we just need to import just react and create a stateless

04:39.240 --> 04:40.200
component.

04:40.350 --> 04:42.440
So I'm going to go right here at the top.

04:42.450 --> 04:48.690
I'm going to copy this and paste it right here and remove the components cause it and I hate it.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.440
We have to import re-act from Riyadh.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.510
Let's get.

04:51.510 --> 04:57.510
So we're going to use link because whenever we go to the actual project instead here we have two links.

04:57.630 --> 05:02.230
So we need to import link from reac router.

05:02.280 --> 05:08.230
I'm going to say link and then from re-act router.

05:09.060 --> 05:14.720
Don Burguet going to go right here and begin to create a function to render the header.

05:14.790 --> 05:20.090
So I'm going to say Kunst header and this one is going to be equal to something we had.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.740
We didn't have any arguments.

05:21.930 --> 05:29.190
So we're going to go right here and just return a letter and I say return and begin to have a header

05:29.640 --> 05:37.180
header and right here which is going to return a div that's going to say headers.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.260
So we can make sure that it's importing the file correctly.

05:40.260 --> 05:46.770
So OK we have this component and we need to make this components available from other components.

05:46.830 --> 05:54.030
So we say export default and then just had her there go.

05:54.170 --> 05:57.860
Now let's do the same thing with the footer since it's pretty much same logic.

05:57.860 --> 06:02.800
I'm just going to copy all go to footer paste it right here.

06:02.990 --> 06:04.900
Just called footer.

06:05.180 --> 06:10.590
Going to change the export and right here I'm going to say footer.

06:10.790 --> 06:11.100
All right.

06:11.150 --> 06:13.170
Let's go to the main project.

06:13.350 --> 06:15.440
Let's reload the page and.

06:15.480 --> 06:22.090
OK I cannot resolve no that's good because we didn't have a home so we can go to component's right here

06:22.100 --> 06:27.140
to components and we can create a new file that is going to be home.

06:27.270 --> 06:29.840
That is good.

06:30.020 --> 06:30.260
OK.

06:30.260 --> 06:34.560
This home that Jay asked is going to do a lot a lot of things.

06:34.700 --> 06:37.860
So this home is going to be a class based component.

06:38.140 --> 06:45.200
So OK so I'm going to go right here to app and copy that react and components so that we can save some

06:45.200 --> 06:45.680
time.

06:45.740 --> 06:51.500
Just going to be at home I get to have react and components.

06:51.500 --> 06:56.180
Now I'm going to just create the class and return something so we can skip this error message.

06:56.210 --> 07:00.000
So it's going to be a class and the class is going to be called home.

07:00.200 --> 07:06.370
It's going to extend the re-act component and then we just do all the logic right here.

07:06.590 --> 07:11.950
So for the for class of class based component we need to render to use the render method.

07:12.050 --> 07:17.150
So I can say render than open close and just return some GSX.

07:17.150 --> 07:19.430
So it's going to be you return.

07:19.970 --> 07:23.470
And then just home or whatever.

07:23.990 --> 07:26.990
So we need to make this class available from other components.

07:27.140 --> 07:29.950
So I'm going to say export default.

07:30.170 --> 07:33.830
And then how.

07:33.860 --> 07:34.650
All right.

07:34.660 --> 07:39.800
So right here whenever the pitch loads we have just three things we have the header.

07:39.820 --> 07:40.930
So it's working.

07:40.990 --> 07:42.040
We have home.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.320
So that's working and we have the footer.

07:44.680 --> 07:48.870
So OK let's start building the first component beginning.

07:49.140 --> 07:54.520
We're going to bring the header right now on the next section and we're going to start doing the main

07:54.520 --> 07:54.930
banner.
