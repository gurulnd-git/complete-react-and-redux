WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:02.760
OK so let's go to the styles.

00:03.410 --> 00:07.490
And at some styling for this because you know it's really ugly.

00:07.490 --> 00:12.640
So I'm going to go put teams right here and we're going to start doing doing the styles.

00:12.680 --> 00:21.830
So I'm going to say teams and teams and then underscore components as one is the main wrapper.

00:21.950 --> 00:30.420
So this one is going to have a min height because if we just make a search for filter everything and

00:30.420 --> 00:32.000
there's only one result.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.800
Now if the container is going to get very small and we can have the footer just spread here on top and

00:36.800 --> 00:37.720
we don't want that.

00:37.940 --> 00:43.940
So I'm going to set a mean height of 800 pixels you know something that is sure.

00:43.940 --> 00:45.290
Now what else do we have.

00:45.290 --> 00:46.480
We have teams input.

00:46.490 --> 00:49.220
It's a style of the team's input.

00:49.220 --> 00:55.520
So I'm going to say team input and it's going to be text text align and center.

00:55.820 --> 00:56.720
Right.

00:57.120 --> 01:05.770
Then we can have a padding and the padding is going to be tiny pixels and zero pixels from the side.

01:06.180 --> 01:10.410
What else we're going to have a background so we get a set of background and the background it's going

01:10.410 --> 01:17.360
to be kind of a gray background is 6 6 6.

01:17.550 --> 01:18.830
Ok so that works.

01:18.850 --> 01:21.580
What else we have to style the input.

01:21.610 --> 01:26.390
So I'm going to say Tim's input and the make reference to the input.

01:27.020 --> 01:27.700
OK.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.910
So we want to set font family for this.

01:30.100 --> 01:32.840
And the phone family it's going to be Rebozo.

01:32.970 --> 01:33.850
I love that name.

01:33.890 --> 01:38.450
Botto so I'm going to say border radios.

01:38.650 --> 01:44.410
And then the radios and it's going to be 30 pixels.

01:45.100 --> 01:45.710
Right.

01:45.850 --> 01:46.870
Ooh what's next.

01:46.870 --> 01:51.120
We're going to have a border and the border is going to be one pixel solid.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.610
And just for fun light gray.

01:54.120 --> 01:54.730
OK.

01:55.300 --> 02:00.640
What else we can have the color the color is going to be black.

02:01.150 --> 02:01.630
Right.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.000
What else we need to set the font size.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.070
You know it's to be bigger than that.

02:06.240 --> 02:10.240
So we're going to say font size and the font size is going to be tiny pixels.

02:10.450 --> 02:15.540
We want to add some padding and the padding is going to be 10 pixels.

02:15.590 --> 02:16.180
Let's.

02:16.740 --> 02:18.130
You one set a fun way.

02:18.160 --> 02:25.330
So it's going to be fun to wait and it's going to be 300 something really slim then diktats line is

02:25.330 --> 02:29.880
going to be center of center.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.870
It looks nice.

02:32.890 --> 02:35.950
I know about you but I just really like it.

02:36.970 --> 02:40.360
So Pacer's that still works good.

02:40.390 --> 02:43.440
So I want to get rid of the focus right here.

02:43.450 --> 02:46.090
The blue border.

02:46.270 --> 02:53.740
So I'm going to go right here the bottom and say Tim's team's input and then just focus and get rid

02:53.740 --> 02:54.460
of that.

02:54.790 --> 02:58.710
We're going to say outlined in the nine.

02:59.720 --> 03:03.620
OK let's get let's some styling to the teams.

03:03.670 --> 03:06.100
This one is going to be really easy to use flex.

03:06.100 --> 03:10.010
So it's going to be teams and then container.

03:10.540 --> 03:15.370
And this one we will need to make reference to this span inside the container.

03:15.370 --> 03:19.420
So it's going to be this play and then flex.

03:19.690 --> 03:20.330
Right.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.950
So we're going to say we're going to set a flex direction.

03:22.960 --> 03:29.650
So it's going to flex direction and it's going to be rolled and then we're going to just use the flex

03:29.650 --> 03:35.870
wrap so we can just put everything one after the other one just like floating moments.

03:35.990 --> 03:36.970
We're going to say wrap

03:40.380 --> 03:45.690
OK well you'll be getting something else on things.

03:45.970 --> 03:47.760
Let's set the width of live.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.250
That's good.

03:48.310 --> 03:49.200
That's the problem.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.590
You say teams container just like before.

03:52.710 --> 03:55.500
We're going to make reference to teams item.

03:56.000 --> 04:06.070
It's going to be Team underscore item and we can set a default with you one for per row so we going

04:06.070 --> 04:09.870
to say 25 percent and that should do the trick.

04:10.430 --> 04:11.640
I got it working.

04:11.650 --> 04:14.080
The thing is that the image is too big and that's the problem.

04:14.080 --> 04:21.830
So we can have a panning of 30 pixels and then a box sizing of border box.

04:22.820 --> 04:23.340
OK.

04:23.410 --> 04:28.990
And the last thing we're going to do is it would be to change the size of image because it's really

04:29.080 --> 04:29.940
really big.

04:29.960 --> 04:37.960
I mean to say teams that underscore container and inside the team's container we going to have a team

04:38.050 --> 04:42.470
item and inside the team item we can have the image.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.550
I'm going to say EMG right.

04:45.580 --> 04:56.430
So now we will set the size of the image to the size of the container and we can do 100 right.

04:56.440 --> 05:00.450
So that works when you just reload the page.

05:00.650 --> 05:03.100
So go to Celtic.

05:04.060 --> 05:04.510
OK.

05:04.510 --> 05:06.360
So it's working just fine.

05:06.670 --> 05:08.510
So go Pacer's.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.690
And if I search my team I'm going to say next.

05:13.870 --> 05:14.370
Let's get.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.410
So it's working.

05:15.580 --> 05:21.020
Now if we click on an item it's going to take us to the inside view.

05:21.190 --> 05:26.000
So now we need to go to Celltex and we need to fetch the information for this component.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.310
And that that will be the last component that you can do.

05:29.320 --> 05:32.510
It is kind of long you know but this is just like this.

05:32.530 --> 05:33.730
It takes time.

05:33.790 --> 05:37.930
So let's go to the next section and finish the project.
