WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:04.430
OK so let's keep moving for it.

00:04.450 --> 00:05.870
You're almost done with this.

00:05.880 --> 00:09.530
What we need to do now is to show the detail of the teaching.

00:09.750 --> 00:12.110
So we need to create a route for this.

00:12.110 --> 00:15.850
So I'm going to go right here on the top and create an import for this.

00:16.050 --> 00:22.130
So we're going to be it's going to be team from and then just team can go.

00:22.140 --> 00:25.320
Don't force slash and team right.

00:25.350 --> 00:27.570
Going to go right here at the bomb and create around.

00:27.690 --> 00:34.060
It's going to be route and exact and begin to select the path.

00:34.150 --> 00:36.930
Now this is up to you can you switch right here.

00:37.080 --> 00:37.930
No.

00:38.420 --> 00:38.670
OK.

00:38.700 --> 00:43.960
So we are we can be entering team and we can pass on ID.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.730
I'm going to say cone and ID right now we need to select the components that is going to render this

00:50.730 --> 00:53.160
information that's going to be team.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.470
And then just close.

00:55.470 --> 00:55.780
Right.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.580
Let's create the component for this.

00:57.750 --> 01:00.460
And again it's going to be called Team.

01:00.470 --> 01:09.570
It's going to be create a new file and team DOD J.S. get team is going to be again just a class based

01:09.570 --> 01:17.110
component because we need to know what we need to render a class fetch the information of the team given

01:17.120 --> 01:17.870
the.

01:18.090 --> 01:21.100
And then just do the rendering.

01:21.420 --> 01:25.100
So again I'm just going to go since we did it many many times.

01:25.280 --> 01:29.230
I'm gonna copy all of this and put it right here.

01:29.700 --> 01:36.190
So I'm going to say first I'm going to create a class that is going to be called Team Force.

01:36.390 --> 01:38.950
It's going to be team right.

01:38.980 --> 01:43.740
It's expanse and then component.

01:43.760 --> 01:44.250
Right.

01:44.270 --> 01:50.660
Going to create a class and just do that so we know what to do since his classmates component.

01:50.820 --> 01:55.690
And we're going to use the state I'm going to just go right ahead and write whatever we need to use.

01:55.710 --> 02:00.890
We're going to be using a constructor with prompts super props.

02:01.050 --> 02:06.160
You know it's always the same idea you know once you get the flow of this it's really really simple.

02:06.210 --> 02:12.990
It's going to be this state and this one is going to be equal to some data are going to say data and

02:12.990 --> 02:18.100
right here we're going to store all the data of this particular team.

02:18.470 --> 02:18.710
OK.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.010
So we will need a render.

02:20.010 --> 02:27.120
So I'm going to say render and then just open and close and we will return some data and say here can

02:27.120 --> 02:31.810
I say Dave and team we need to make this component available.

02:31.830 --> 02:40.520
So I'm going to say export Export default and then team.

02:40.540 --> 02:41.830
Right.

02:42.060 --> 02:44.000
We should be getting something team.

02:44.010 --> 02:47.620
All right let's get now when the component.

02:47.820 --> 02:52.120
We need to call the component that amount to fetch the information.

02:52.260 --> 03:01.740
So again say component did mount and nothing you right here we need to do a fetch.

03:01.740 --> 03:08.790
Now the fetch is going to be in local host whatever port you have for Slash teams just like we did before.

03:08.810 --> 03:12.360
So I'm going to create a U R L that is going to contain that.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.920
That location is going to be you or L team.

03:16.100 --> 03:16.590
OK.

03:16.890 --> 03:23.400
This one is going to be equal to local host and whatever location and then just teams.

03:23.400 --> 03:23.830
All right.

03:23.870 --> 03:28.640
I'm going to go right here and create the fetch for this and I say Fetch.

03:28.740 --> 03:35.440
We whenever we fetch we pass that you are l of team right here.

03:35.790 --> 03:37.060
And we need to.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.720
We need to do something else on the gist of this.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.280
We're going to create tactics.

03:41.550 --> 03:48.450
I'm going to just call this team you are l and whatever we're calling this if we just call two teams

03:48.740 --> 03:53.620
you can get a list of all the teams and we do want that which is one to get one team.

03:53.670 --> 03:55.170
So we do Jason's server.

03:55.170 --> 04:01.720
You can just request the team and then the name of the team is going to search for that.

04:01.740 --> 04:09.420
So to do this we do a question mark and we search my name and this one is going to be equal to whatever

04:09.480 --> 04:11.080
we have right here.

04:11.160 --> 04:18.060
Now if you remember with re-act router what you can do you can you can have you can have this program

04:18.270 --> 04:23.380
inside there's the props that match that times and then Id.

04:23.640 --> 04:31.850
So we can get from there going to go right here and say this that prompts that match that programs don't

04:32.070 --> 04:33.900
Id look at.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.700
Let's get let's get to work.

04:35.700 --> 04:39.820
So next we need to select the method just like we did previously.

04:39.840 --> 04:46.310
The method is going to be called to get right next.

04:46.380 --> 04:52.370
Whenever we do get we need to grab whatever we have on the body and go to get to Jason.

04:52.380 --> 05:01.280
So going to say I'm going to say then opening close grab the response and do the Jasen response rather

05:01.290 --> 05:03.050
Jason.

05:03.450 --> 05:04.170
Right.

05:04.200 --> 05:11.550
And whenever we get to Jason we need to run a callback and update the state so we can say Jaison then

05:12.440 --> 05:15.290
run the call Mac says you want to change this state.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.530
We're going to say this.

05:16.530 --> 05:24.240
That said state and again we just grabbed the data we have right here and we say that this one is going

05:24.240 --> 05:26.040
to be equal to Jason.

05:26.180 --> 05:26.830
Right.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.810
We get no wires.

05:27.810 --> 05:30.410
So in theory should be good.

05:30.810 --> 05:32.200
So what do we need right now.

05:32.460 --> 05:38.290
We need to render something and we need to render a list of what we have inside data that Chaisson.

05:38.490 --> 05:43.970
So I'm going to go just make space right here and put a class to the container.

05:43.980 --> 05:49.860
It's going to be class name you know team data right here.

05:49.890 --> 05:55.680
We need to create a function that is going to loop the data that we have inside the team.

05:55.710 --> 06:03.660
So it's going to be this that render data and what we're going to do we can get past that that this

06:03.660 --> 06:11.120
data sets that because the information it's going to be inside the state right.

06:11.280 --> 06:11.710
OK.

06:11.870 --> 06:12.690
Let's get.

06:13.020 --> 06:19.740
So I'm going to call this function that it's going to be rendered data and render data.

06:19.960 --> 06:25.940
We just say equal to some data and then just run the function.

06:25.990 --> 06:32.890
Now whenever we pass to the state data we want it's going to be inside this that sets these that state

06:32.980 --> 06:40.320
that data so we can make use of this structuring and say data right.

06:40.360 --> 06:47.440
We don't really need to use a map I'm just going to use it you know just to get you used to use the

06:47.440 --> 06:48.100
map.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.500
So we need to call the data we have.

06:50.640 --> 06:59.320
If we can a map over it I'm going to open it close and get out just call function open and close and

06:59.320 --> 07:00.980
then just run whatever we have.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.940
And we passed an item.

07:03.290 --> 07:03.840
OK.

07:04.480 --> 07:11.680
So now what we need to do we need to return some GSX Sex and the sex is just going to be a dip.

07:12.030 --> 07:12.680
Right.

07:13.030 --> 07:15.770
So each item needs to have a key.

07:15.940 --> 07:20.700
So we can to call the item docked Id get

07:23.400 --> 07:28.920
what else are we going to call the we can add a class name to this element.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.430
So it's going to be Team data and then wrapper makes sense.

07:36.080 --> 07:36.520
OK.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.320
So we're going to need a few things.

07:38.930 --> 07:41.790
If you check the original this is the final one.

07:41.810 --> 07:47.710
We have the image in the left the description in the right and then begin to do this.

07:47.750 --> 07:50.190
So OK so I'm going to create a container for that.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.980
But first you can say dev.

07:54.690 --> 07:56.160
Weird dev.

07:56.330 --> 08:00.100
And inside the div we can add to the image.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.670
But first I'm going to add a class name to it.

08:02.930 --> 08:06.410
And this one is going to be left right.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.740
You're going to call to an image.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.840
So I'm going to say EMG and just close it.

08:10.970 --> 08:17.030
And what we need to do we need selecting old and we need to pass the item and I'm going to pass the

08:17.030 --> 08:19.340
name for this.

08:19.350 --> 08:20.520
We select the source.

08:20.540 --> 08:27.440
So it's going to be called to as I see an opening close and right here we need to use template strings

08:27.740 --> 08:29.180
to pass the location.

08:29.180 --> 08:37.790
So it's going to be just for Shlash teams for Slash and whatever information we have inside the logo

08:37.880 --> 08:39.220
on the Jason.

08:39.590 --> 08:42.400
Now just logo right.

08:42.410 --> 08:51.340
So it's going to be item that logo Let's go back and this could mean that it means that we are calling

08:51.350 --> 08:51.980
it spring.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.540
Everything so it's working nicely.

08:54.600 --> 09:00.770
Let's create the all the container and the container that the one that has the title and the description.

09:00.810 --> 09:03.270
So this one we're going to call it.

09:03.600 --> 09:09.950
Of course if the other one with the left this one is going to be called right now.

09:10.860 --> 09:11.170
OK.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.530
So we can have a title.

09:12.570 --> 09:13.350
I'm going to call.

09:13.350 --> 09:15.090
I'm going to use an H1 tag.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.710
That's going to be equal to the team.

09:17.750 --> 09:22.450
Oh sorry item that name right.

09:22.510 --> 09:24.160
Going to bring the description.

09:24.210 --> 09:27.210
So this one is going to be just a simple tag.

09:27.420 --> 09:30.150
And we're going to bring the item that the description

09:33.590 --> 09:36.510
well on there we go.

09:37.010 --> 09:37.250
Right.

09:37.250 --> 09:37.890
So.

09:37.980 --> 09:38.290
OK.

09:38.330 --> 09:40.540
So it works nicely.

09:40.550 --> 09:42.980
The final one has a squad right here.

09:43.150 --> 09:47.990
It's going to go and create new elements right here and I'm going to tell you in a few seconds what

09:48.290 --> 09:55.450
you are going to do just a horizontal ruler just a line and then I'm going to curl.

09:55.460 --> 10:00.630
I'm going to create new elements and this new element is going to contain squat.

10:00.630 --> 10:05.530
It's going to say class name and it's quite good.

10:05.540 --> 10:12.710
Now the thing is that this squad is going to be an array of players just just like that.

10:12.850 --> 10:16.440
You know it's going to be just like this.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.350
So we need to map over it.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.990
So I don't want to do it right here.

10:22.070 --> 10:29.750
So I'm going to call to a different function but it's going to be called render squad and the render

10:29.750 --> 10:37.120
squad is going to take the item that is Quon.

10:37.340 --> 10:37.810
Right.

10:37.820 --> 10:44.510
And this is going to just loop over the squad and just bring the information is going to just kill the

10:44.510 --> 10:46.820
script because we didn't have this function.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.990
Let's go to the next section and just add the renderers.

10:50.220 --> 10:52.430
And I'm not going to take a lot of time.
