00:00.930 --> 00:04.030
All right so let out some styles to this Slider.

00:04.200 --> 00:07.100
I'm going to just paste right here.

00:07.110 --> 00:13.290
The separator and we want to make reference to item dash slider.

00:13.290 --> 00:14.120
All right.

00:14.440 --> 00:20.400
And we're going to just add some styles and I'm going to put the hide of 700 pixels and now we get it.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.490
Notice the difference.

00:21.570 --> 00:23.120
All right let's get.

00:23.140 --> 00:23.840
So let's.

00:23.880 --> 00:25.320
We don't need to do a lot more.

00:25.350 --> 00:28.020
We need to set the background size to cover.

00:28.020 --> 00:36.430
So I'm going to say background and then set the size to cover and then important.

00:36.820 --> 00:37.330
Let's get.

00:37.390 --> 00:42.640
So it's going to center just said the background size this cover is going to fit the whole container.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.850
Now what I'm going to do I'm going to set the background position to center.

00:45.850 --> 00:55.330
So I'm going to say background and then position to center center send her.

00:55.810 --> 00:57.580
You're going to make it a position relative.

00:57.610 --> 01:00.760
So we can float the captions.

01:00.790 --> 01:03.830
So I'm going to say position relative.

01:04.870 --> 01:10.310
And we're going to use a font family inside here and we're going to use that for all of one.

01:10.320 --> 01:15.530
You can just copy it from here and paste it right at the bottom.

01:15.610 --> 01:22.030
Burguet So we're going to make reference to items either again and make reference to the caption.

01:22.050 --> 01:29.770
So I going to say Dot caption right so the caption is going to have a color of white and we can see

01:29.770 --> 01:30.700
it now.

01:30.990 --> 01:31.930
OK that's good.

01:31.930 --> 01:32.970
We have the caption.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.460
So what are we going to do.

01:34.460 --> 01:40.480
We're going to make a position absolute and the position absolute.

01:40.480 --> 01:49.820
We want to make it ride zero pixels and then panning and the panning is going to be tiny pixels.

01:50.370 --> 01:51.160
OK.

01:51.550 --> 01:53.870
We want to align it to the right.

01:53.890 --> 02:00.490
So I'm going to say text align and the text line is going to be to the right.

02:00.490 --> 02:06.120
Forget now right here we have zero can say just zero.

02:06.120 --> 02:14.170
What else we want to set with initial width and the width is going to be 320 pixels.

02:14.970 --> 02:24.840
And we want to transform the text to uppercase So we will say text transform and then uppercase Burguet

02:26.010 --> 02:26.610
looks nice.

02:26.610 --> 02:30.390
Let's modify the 8:4 so it can be a lot bigger.

02:30.420 --> 02:35.180
I'm going to say item slider and we're going to make reference to that H for tag.

02:35.400 --> 02:43.650
We have some styles already on the 8:4 and we going to say font and font weight and the font weight

02:43.650 --> 02:49.420
is going to be 300 and you can add a margin of zero pixels.

02:50.990 --> 02:51.280
Right.

02:51.290 --> 02:55.690
If we have zero we can get rid of the pixels.

02:55.740 --> 03:01.480
Now let's add some styles to the to the text right here.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.180
Top score of the week.

03:03.260 --> 03:05.370
So we need to add some styles to that.

03:05.400 --> 03:13.790
I'm going to say item slider and then make reference to dot caption and I forgot to do it right here.

03:13.820 --> 03:18.170
Make the reference still working but now it's just better the caption.

03:18.200 --> 03:21.240
And we're going to make reference to the p tag.

03:21.590 --> 03:31.330
And we want to font size we have right here font size and the font size is going to be 70 pixels.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.490
OK.

03:32.720 --> 03:36.110
Kind of looks nice at the margin.

03:36.950 --> 03:37.990
And then top.

03:38.210 --> 03:41.260
And we're going to make it zero pixels.

03:41.400 --> 03:46.040
That could be better looks nicer at it that way.

03:46.130 --> 03:47.680
Now right now it's really small.

03:47.690 --> 03:49.680
If we make it bigger it's nicer.

03:50.610 --> 03:51.770
OK let's get.

03:51.770 --> 03:54.110
So we are done with the with the slider.

03:54.110 --> 03:55.640
Everything is working fine.

03:55.640 --> 04:03.320
Now let's go to the next section and start doing the next part which is can it be the subscribed to

04:03.320 --> 04:03.820
us.

04:03.920 --> 04:08.930
And right now it's not taking the center center with the background position and it's because they forgot

04:08.930 --> 04:13.620
to put important no.

04:13.850 --> 04:17.360
And that's much much better.

04:18.180 --> 04:18.950
There we go.

04:18.960 --> 04:23.980
So now we're going to do this this described to us whenever the user subscribes.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.130
We're going to add something.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.560
And if it's not right it's going to say check your e-mail.

04:27.660 --> 04:31.800
And if it's right it's going to add it to the DVD adjacent to the database.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.380
Let's go to the next section and did this.
