WEBVTT

00:00.980 --> 00:03.080
OK let's start with the styles.

00:03.230 --> 00:08.930
I'm going to go to the main directory and get to go to public and I'm going to add a new folder that's

00:08.960 --> 00:11.020
going to be CSSA lowercase.

00:11.050 --> 00:11.940
Yes.

00:12.140 --> 00:16.930
And inside I will create and you fold and you file that it's going to be styles.

00:17.120 --> 00:22.860
That's the style to Singler that CSSA could be styles zem doesn't really matter.

00:23.310 --> 00:26.000
OK now we're going to use two fonts.

00:26.070 --> 00:29.510
Lynn Nicolas's we're going to use two different fonts.

00:29.510 --> 00:32.680
We go to Google and I'm just going to delete that just close that.

00:32.780 --> 00:36.040
And again it just searched fonts from right from the start.

00:36.080 --> 00:42.410
So I'm going to say Google font and then botto I'm doing this because maybe you don't know how to get

00:42.410 --> 00:45.570
the funds from Google funds so apt are just going to show you.

00:45.740 --> 00:47.440
So we're going to go to Google fonds.

00:47.560 --> 00:48.210
Oh sorry.

00:48.230 --> 00:48.990
We're going to go back.

00:49.130 --> 00:52.090
Since we search for Gobodo we have here we're botto.

00:52.130 --> 00:59.400
Google Fonte so you can have all the fonts and right here the top we select the font going to open this

00:59.490 --> 01:02.820
and I'm going to just customize this because I want more styles.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.860
I want to bring the light the regular the medium and the Bold.

01:07.920 --> 01:12.930
Maybe we are not going to use all of them but for now it doesn't matter in real life if you're not using

01:12.930 --> 01:13.770
fonts.

01:13.790 --> 01:17.490
Try to keep this of course because it takes more time to load.

01:17.760 --> 01:21.380
OK we're going to go to embed and begin to use one more font.

01:21.630 --> 01:23.100
I'm going to go right here at the top.

01:23.100 --> 01:31.230
The search and right here begin to type f j A and B can be used just one valid one.

01:31.260 --> 01:37.440
I don't know how how this is pronounced so are going to add it and then I'm going to go to families

01:37.530 --> 01:41.430
selected and the hollow one has only one style.

01:41.460 --> 01:42.840
It's going to be regular.

01:42.840 --> 01:46.960
So we can copy the embed just get a copy of this.

01:47.420 --> 01:53.430
OK I'm going to go to our project to the index not e-mail and I'm going to just copy all of this at

01:53.430 --> 01:55.090
the top right.

01:55.410 --> 01:57.170
So we need to import this.

01:57.290 --> 01:58.810
SS Well it's a link.

01:58.860 --> 02:05.330
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to say link and then rail and style sheet

02:05.960 --> 02:07.520
style sheet.

02:07.740 --> 02:09.720
Bigger than we need to link it.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.240
So it's going to be a ref.

02:11.310 --> 02:18.740
It's going to be inside for Shlash C Ss for Slash style that the SS.

02:19.450 --> 02:22.640
And then we're going to close it right.

02:22.680 --> 02:27.690
I'm going to close this and just bring this make this a little bit smaller.

02:28.060 --> 02:28.440
OK.

02:28.460 --> 02:30.100
We're going to start with the stands right now.

02:30.200 --> 02:36.080
So I'm going to go to style that's the SS and just add some set up stops on substance just a default

02:36.080 --> 02:36.870
style.

02:36.920 --> 02:41.890
So going to say body and the body is going to have a margin of zero pixels.

02:42.410 --> 02:50.090
You can have a padding of square pixels of course merging padding zero and I made stake here here going

02:50.090 --> 02:52.330
to say Margene Burgert.

02:52.850 --> 02:55.530
So we're going to use a font family for all of this.

02:55.670 --> 03:00.280
So I'm going to say font and then family and the font family by default.

03:00.410 --> 03:02.210
It's going to be a botto.

03:02.210 --> 03:02.920
Right.

03:03.030 --> 03:09.010
And we to change the color the color is going to be kind of a darker color.

03:09.080 --> 03:17.210
It's going to be one B one B one B so good we know that it's working.

03:17.210 --> 03:19.930
It's linking the siestas correctly that's good.

03:20.030 --> 03:22.030
So we're going to use that flex box container.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.430
We're going to set it up right now.

03:23.430 --> 03:30.080
It's going to be flex valks flex box and then container.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.800
And I'm just going to copy from here.

03:32.960 --> 03:38.170
We're going to make it flex so we can have the M-S flex for Microsoft.

03:38.490 --> 03:41.970
For Internet Explorer or acha or whatever then the web kid.

03:42.140 --> 03:50.740
And then just default flex we can add a default state for the links so we can remove that text decoration

03:50.750 --> 03:53.690
that really ugly text correction.

03:53.690 --> 03:55.200
Right.

03:55.350 --> 03:56.420
OK that's fine.

03:56.530 --> 04:01.500
I'm going to add more things right now so we can just use it whenever we hit the home.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.510
I can add style for the H.

04:03.610 --> 04:11.200
3 I'm going to say font family and the fun family is going to be that weird font it's going to be Hala.

04:11.510 --> 04:13.710
And then one.

04:14.260 --> 04:18.050
You know we you could add some default style right here.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.270
You know just to save time.

04:19.310 --> 04:21.600
I'm just not going to do it.

04:21.610 --> 04:23.080
We're going to add more thanks.

04:23.090 --> 04:33.630
This H-3 is going to be a fun size of 35 pixels than font weight font.

04:35.580 --> 04:39.610
And then wait there we go and it's going to be 300.

04:40.110 --> 04:41.700
And just the margin bottom

04:45.030 --> 04:46.330
of zero.

04:46.890 --> 04:50.330
Now we don't have this tax right now but we're going to have it in a minute.

04:50.330 --> 04:53.520
So I'm just saving time in doing it doing it right now.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.500
This fun family is going to be for Halloween.

04:55.530 --> 04:58.380
I'm just going to copy and paste at the font size.

04:58.410 --> 05:04.380
It's going to be 30 tiny pixels such as going to copy and paste tiny pixels.

05:04.380 --> 05:04.950
Right.

05:05.070 --> 05:06.650
So everything looks good.

05:06.690 --> 05:11.270
Now one thing we're going to add a margin to this is going to be a weird margin.

05:11.280 --> 05:18.190
We can add 15 pixels than zero pixels and you can get the pixel right here and then five pixels.

05:18.710 --> 05:19.300
OK.

05:19.410 --> 05:20.240
So it looks nice.

05:20.250 --> 05:24.660
Let's add the styles for the header and the future we have right now.

05:24.660 --> 05:33.170
So I'm just going to add a comment right here so we can know that we are studying the header and footer.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.550
So let's go back.

05:36.630 --> 05:38.990
We're going to make reference to Hetter.

05:39.150 --> 05:42.070
So I'm going to say Hetter right.

05:42.120 --> 05:49.490
And this is going to have a border border bottom of one pixel solid.

05:49.590 --> 05:57.020
It's going to be not white but kind of similar to E-2 into E2.

05:57.660 --> 05:58.810
And we can see it right here.

05:58.830 --> 06:01.780
You can see the the line.

06:02.100 --> 06:07.800
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and since the header and footer are going to share some

06:07.800 --> 06:13.570
styles I can see I can say Hetter coma footer and we can add some styles.

06:13.590 --> 06:17.730
This is going to have a background of hash tag and then white.

06:18.160 --> 06:25.230
We can align items and the line items is going to be center we can add a padding and the padding is

06:25.230 --> 06:30.680
going to be 10 pixels beginning and used on family and the font family for this.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.820
It's going to be the same one as for Halloween.

06:32.820 --> 06:36.610
So I'm just going to copy and paste right.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.220
Let's get it looks like it's working.

06:39.270 --> 06:41.280
Now let's add the styles to the logo.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.950
Let's bring that logo.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.530
We're going to say Hetter and the make reference to the logo.

06:46.800 --> 06:53.130
And since we're going to use the same thing for the footer I'm just going to copy this do a coma and

06:53.250 --> 07:02.010
make reference to the footer because we pretty much have it the same logo on top and the same logo at

07:02.010 --> 07:04.600
the bottom says we're using Fluxbox.

07:04.740 --> 07:09.340
We're going to use flex and then engro.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.280
It's going to be one.

07:11.670 --> 07:20.370
And then height and the hide we're going to give the full tide of twenty two pixels and get OK.

07:20.390 --> 07:23.180
So it looks like it's kind of working.

07:23.180 --> 07:26.280
So let's add the image for the logos.

07:26.330 --> 07:33.590
So I'm going to say Hetter Dan Dadds logo and then span says we're going to use the same thing for the

07:33.590 --> 07:34.080
footer.

07:34.110 --> 07:39.510
I'm just going to copy of this comma and then just make reference to the footer.

07:40.400 --> 07:40.640
Right.

07:40.640 --> 07:45.280
So we can begin to bring the logo from the images folder.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.640
I gave you right here.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.540
So we have it available inside the images folder.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.320
So I'm going to say background.

07:52.360 --> 07:57.930
I'm going to use your L and then just quote.

07:58.550 --> 08:02.910
So I'm going to say for Slash we can access the images directory.

08:03.140 --> 08:06.290
Then Logo dot P and G.

08:06.290 --> 08:13.500
And of course it's going to be no repeat Burguet so we can it make it inspanned.

08:13.580 --> 08:19.020
We want to make it this plot display in line block what.

08:19.230 --> 08:19.530
OK.

08:19.580 --> 08:23.280
So we have to make it right with.

08:24.230 --> 08:27.280
Let's do it again with a go.

08:27.320 --> 08:31.820
Are we going to have 58 pixels is something really dumb.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.750
Height and 24 pixels.

08:35.370 --> 08:36.680
Ok we get the logo.

08:36.680 --> 08:37.230
That's good.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.750
So it looks nice.

08:38.750 --> 08:43.540
Now the back of the footer has kind of a darker color.

08:43.540 --> 08:48.960
So I'm just going to give a style to this and this much is going to be the end of the section.

08:49.120 --> 08:54.210
I going to add a background and the background is going to be kind of a dark color.

08:54.620 --> 08:58.470
And then it's going to be one f f f.

08:59.090 --> 09:05.350
You can add a margin top so we can split the B can separate the footer from the previous section.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.400
So I'm going to say 30 pixels.

09:08.720 --> 09:14.560
Let's go to the project and you know it looks nice could do better but looks nice right.

09:14.570 --> 09:20.090
So let's go to the next section and begin to start bringing the slider for this.
