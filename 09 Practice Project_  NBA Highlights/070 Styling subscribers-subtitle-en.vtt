WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:02.570
OK so let's add some styles of this.

00:02.600 --> 00:07.950
I'm going to go to the subscribe right here on the styles again to make reference to the subscriber

00:08.010 --> 00:08.540
panel.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.320
We're going to add just some styles.

00:10.320 --> 00:13.310
Remember you can go to get have and copy the code.

00:13.320 --> 00:14.050
No problem.

00:14.270 --> 00:21.720
So is going to say text then underscore I'm sorry dash and fat AM line going to align everything to

00:21.720 --> 00:22.510
the center.

00:22.560 --> 00:26.740
So I'm going to say Center Burguet so you can have a pretty fine with.

00:26.880 --> 00:34.500
It's going to be three hundred and fixed and 50 pixels and begin to set it Margene to zero out all.

00:34.650 --> 00:39.720
So we can censor everything right now looks nicer.

00:39.720 --> 00:40.870
It's going to go right here.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.830
You're going to make reference to these three takk.

00:44.010 --> 00:49.060
So again Subscribe Subscribe panel and then age three.

00:49.320 --> 00:56.280
So we want to make it a fun family we a whole of one or whatever it copied from here and I'm going to

00:56.280 --> 01:00.120
say from family for one get.

01:00.120 --> 01:06.350
So we wanted a different font size so I'm going to say font size and it's going to be 35 pixels.

01:06.510 --> 01:08.200
We're going to set the font weight.

01:08.370 --> 01:13.660
So it's going to be font and weight and 300 right.

01:14.070 --> 01:17.020
And we're going to get rid of the margin by default.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.650
So I'm going to say margin bottom and zero

01:22.360 --> 01:22.660
right.

01:22.770 --> 01:28.550
OK so now let's do the Emperor styled but because it's really ugly.

01:28.750 --> 01:36.520
You're going to say Sisk describe panel again and then we make reference to the input get so the input

01:36.670 --> 01:38.330
is going to have a border radius.

01:38.440 --> 01:45.550
So I'm going to say border border and then radius and it's going to be tiny pixels.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.140
Again it just said add some border to it.

01:48.160 --> 01:55.660
So they're going to say border and is going to be three three pixels and then solid and then just DDD

01:55.750 --> 02:00.080
DDD is just a nice segue right.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.220
Nice.

02:01.350 --> 02:01.760
So.

02:01.770 --> 02:02.140
OK.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.910
We're going to make it bigger I'm sorry you're going to line the whole text.

02:06.010 --> 02:13.700
So I'm going to say text align center then went to change the font size is going to be font font size

02:14.620 --> 02:17.910
and then the font size to be turned into pixels.

02:18.070 --> 02:18.690
Right.

02:18.730 --> 02:21.250
We want to add some padding to it so it's going to be padding.

02:21.370 --> 02:24.800
And then just 10 pixels in it looks better.

02:25.260 --> 02:29.950
Ok so I'm going to add margin because everything is kind of together right here.

02:29.950 --> 02:37.780
So it is margin some pixels from the top and bottom and then sets just zero from the left side and from

02:37.780 --> 02:39.240
the sides.

02:39.430 --> 02:39.790
Right.

02:39.820 --> 02:41.920
What else if I just click and care.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.020
You get the focus.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.420
You're going to get the weight of the focus going to go right here.

02:46.420 --> 02:49.780
Copy paste and you make reference to focus

02:53.340 --> 02:54.910
there you go focus.

02:55.300 --> 03:01.900
And the way we get rid of this is going to be outline and it's going to be outline with I believe

03:04.910 --> 03:06.970
zero.

03:08.350 --> 03:09.280
There we go.

03:09.760 --> 03:10.010
OK.

03:10.040 --> 03:14.310
So now we want to style this small right here the text we have.

03:14.390 --> 03:16.630
It's kind of a disclaimer.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.920
Whenever we we just subscribe.

03:19.100 --> 03:22.070
So I'm going to call again says Dr. panel.

03:22.070 --> 03:23.680
And then just call small.

03:23.750 --> 03:29.630
We made a small for that and it's going to have a font size font size and it's going to be really small

03:29.700 --> 03:36.550
10 pixels and just a line height of you know to see what pixels are going to make it through a small

03:37.980 --> 03:39.460
market.

03:39.690 --> 03:44.790
You know it's nice we have the earth ready so we don't need to do the rest.

03:44.870 --> 03:46.640
So let's try one more time.

03:46.740 --> 03:54.780
You say Francis at gmail dot com OK it passes Burguet.

03:54.780 --> 03:57.290
So if I say whatever answer we get.

03:57.290 --> 03:58.270
Check your e-mail.

03:58.430 --> 03:59.510
So this is working.

03:59.790 --> 04:06.110
But let's go to the next section and we will start creating the blocks the animated blanks right here.

04:06.290 --> 04:08.060
Let's go to the next section right now.
