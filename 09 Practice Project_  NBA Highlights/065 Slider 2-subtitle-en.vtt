WEBVTT

00:00.780 --> 00:07.830
OK so let's add the slider so we can use to react to Slick's later and we can have a lot of documentation

00:07.830 --> 00:08.460
for this.

00:08.550 --> 00:12.750
If you used react this six letter from J Querrey that same idea.

00:13.020 --> 00:18.210
So first what we need to do we need to import the slider from re-act slept.

00:18.330 --> 00:28.670
So I'm going to say import and then slider from and then react like it's going to be re-act slick BRIGA.

00:29.130 --> 00:36.090
So now if we check the documentation there react slider uses some settings right here whenever we trigger

00:36.180 --> 00:36.670
the slider.

00:36.690 --> 00:43.350
We can do this right now but before that to to show the slider is going to use is going to use some

00:43.650 --> 00:47.650
some success you know so what do we need to do.

00:47.650 --> 00:55.760
We need to grab all of this right here and just add it in South inside index over have right here.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.150
And just going to copy and paste.

00:58.390 --> 01:01.090
So that is the only thing we need right now.

01:01.090 --> 01:02.250
So I'm just going to close this.

01:02.260 --> 01:05.650
Just go back and go back to featured.

01:05.860 --> 01:06.870
Now what do we need to do.

01:06.950 --> 01:11.420
We're calling this featured component and we are receiving props.

01:11.590 --> 01:17.340
So now what we need to do we need to trigger a kind of a function and just loop.

01:17.470 --> 01:19.590
This prompts you're receiving.

01:19.740 --> 01:25.660
So I'm going to I'm going to just the lead slider and I get a call to a function that is going to be

01:25.660 --> 01:32.490
called generate slides generated slides.

01:33.070 --> 01:38.690
This one is going to be passing the props that we are receiving right here.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.850
Now I'm going to go just right here.

01:41.080 --> 01:47.020
On top of feature and I'm just going to call to this function you're going to stored inside of our will

01:47.320 --> 01:49.750
and this one is going to receive some props.

01:50.050 --> 01:53.800
And then just run that function get.

01:54.020 --> 01:54.260
Right.

01:54.260 --> 02:02.110
So since we're passing props the slides are going to be available inside Propst dot slides.

02:02.120 --> 02:08.310
If I just inspect this and go to the council we have here it's props sleights.

02:08.330 --> 02:09.820
And then the data.

02:10.010 --> 02:16.300
I don't want to do this I don't want to do is just access directly to slides since I'm passing probs.

02:16.370 --> 02:21.950
I'm going to make use of these structuring and enter the slides.

02:22.040 --> 02:22.560
That's good.

02:23.380 --> 02:23.820
Looks nice.

02:23.820 --> 02:29.700
Now whenever we just come into this component the feature first props is going to be empty.

02:29.890 --> 02:33.020
So if we map over ED going to get an error.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.250
So what are you going to do.

02:34.270 --> 02:40.120
Going to go right here and create a conditional and we all we've all read this and I'm going to check

02:40.150 --> 02:49.140
if it's sleights it's empty and if it's not we're going to run the map now to use the slick slider.

02:49.390 --> 02:50.700
Well the first thing we need to do.

02:50.710 --> 02:53.700
Just like reactor's incisions group same idea.

02:53.780 --> 02:58.510
We need to wrap everything inside a component that is going to be called slider.

02:58.520 --> 02:59.150
So OK.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.170
Since we want to return something.

03:01.210 --> 03:03.660
I'm going to return something.

03:03.760 --> 03:11.570
But the first thing we need to do is to call this slider slider right.

03:12.040 --> 03:14.560
The slider is going to take some settings.

03:14.740 --> 03:22.300
If I go right here and check the data we can detect some settings and we start slider and then we pass

03:22.300 --> 03:28.390
the sayings you know whenever we use this is kind of up right here in the settings we have dots through

03:28.390 --> 03:29.440
for example.

03:29.440 --> 03:36.220
So this is equal to doing darts equal and then just passing through or whatever.

03:36.220 --> 03:37.270
It's the same idea.

03:37.270 --> 03:43.330
The only thing is that we are doing it like this with this spread operator and it looks better.

03:43.330 --> 03:49.570
So I'm just going to delete all this and I'm going to go right here and create some settings that we

03:49.570 --> 03:51.460
need to use for the slider.

03:51.550 --> 03:57.160
So I'm going to say Kunst and settings settings.

03:57.740 --> 04:02.650
Now the settings are going to be it's going to be an object and you can have a lot of settings.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.220
You can have the arrows.

04:04.790 --> 04:06.430
And this one is going to be false.

04:06.440 --> 04:11.300
We don't want arrows you know when the slider starts you can have the arrows in the left and the right.

04:11.330 --> 04:12.780
But we don't want that.

04:12.950 --> 04:18.530
We have the option to use darts by default is true but we're going to set it to False.

04:18.530 --> 04:21.470
We don't want we want it to be infinite.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.640
So I'm going to say infinite

04:26.190 --> 04:29.400
go infinite and this one is going to be true.

04:30.110 --> 04:31.140
Right.

04:31.190 --> 04:34.280
So we want to speed the speed is going to be 500.

04:34.310 --> 04:36.060
You know the speed of the transition.

04:36.230 --> 04:39.020
And then you have two default settings.

04:39.080 --> 04:43.290
It's going to be slides to show.

04:44.390 --> 04:51.050
And then one you know I really kind of don't know what this does but the added on the settings I just

04:52.070 --> 05:02.720
added it is going to be slides to scroll one you can get rid of this and check what's happening.

05:02.750 --> 05:07.090
It's not really good really well documented.

05:07.530 --> 05:08.280
OK.

05:08.360 --> 05:14.870
We're going to grab the settings and since we want to pass all these attributes inside slider what are

05:14.870 --> 05:15.530
we going to do.

05:15.560 --> 05:16.610
Going to use the rest.

05:16.610 --> 05:17.250
Operator.

05:17.270 --> 05:22.460
Just open and close curly braces and do dot dot dot and settings.

05:22.460 --> 05:26.210
And of course it's going to grab the settings and just pass it right here.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.990
So everything kind of looks nice.

05:29.990 --> 05:36.830
Now we need to map overhead because we didn't have data so well it's not going to work because we didn't

05:36.830 --> 05:38.480
have anything inside slides.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.050
So that's why it's giving us an error message.

05:41.060 --> 05:45.130
Now I'm going to go right here and start doing this now.

05:45.410 --> 05:51.980
Whenever we use something like this we need to pass the data right here and a different way.

05:52.100 --> 05:58.450
And what we need to do we need to wrap everything inside collar braces and here I'm going to call this

05:58.540 --> 06:02.970
the slides and I'm going to map over it.

06:03.070 --> 06:05.900
Now each map takes an image function.

06:05.900 --> 06:11.470
So I'm going to do open the the apprentice's then just a function.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.060
All right this function.

06:14.060 --> 06:21.980
Of course this map is going to take an item and what are we going to do in every terms and GSX.

06:21.990 --> 06:24.470
So I'm just going to oh sorry.

06:24.530 --> 06:28.760
If you want to return x we say return OK.

06:28.930 --> 06:32.100
And this is going to return pretty much all the slides.

06:32.290 --> 06:33.810
So I'm going to create a div.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.700
And if you're He should be working.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.020
OK.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.080
So we get no errors.

06:38.110 --> 06:39.140
So that is good.

06:39.490 --> 06:41.190
So if I say slide

06:44.090 --> 06:49.230
the slide key word right here and if we move it you know it's working again.

06:49.460 --> 06:54.220
So let's do the all the mark of this all the GSX for each iteration.

06:54.260 --> 07:00.290
And whenever we use a map we need a key so I'm going to say key and the key is going to be available

07:00.350 --> 07:02.970
inside each element inside Jason.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.700
We have the ID of each slide.

07:05.780 --> 07:08.210
So we going to use that one.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.700
Let me just save this one.

07:09.700 --> 07:10.650
OK.

07:10.940 --> 07:15.490
We're going to use the key and it's going to be item dot ID.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.020
So we're going to add a class name to this.

07:18.050 --> 07:27.090
It's going to be class name and the class name is going to be item underscore the slider.

07:27.320 --> 07:34.850
Now we can add an image as a background image to these to this element.

07:34.850 --> 07:35.860
So what are we going to do.

07:35.880 --> 07:43.310
We're going to say style and two and inline styles in GSX need to wrap everything inside curly braces

07:43.400 --> 07:47.130
and then two curly braces I'm going to say background.

07:47.160 --> 07:58.010
It's just it's a CSSA style back ground and back ground Burguet and we get to pass the values as with

07:58.010 --> 07:58.640
tactics.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.320
It's going to be template strings.

08:00.320 --> 08:07.100
So we get everything the image the cover for this is going to be inside your L inside images the images

08:07.100 --> 08:09.690
directory and then covers.

08:09.710 --> 08:15.280
And then for Slash and we make reference to the data we have right here inside cover which is going

08:15.280 --> 08:16.660
to cover one.

08:16.670 --> 08:17.240
OK.

08:17.570 --> 08:23.930
So a door or whatever currency and then item that cover.

08:24.840 --> 08:25.430
OK.

08:25.750 --> 08:26.440
Let's get.

08:26.450 --> 08:27.980
Looks nice.

08:27.980 --> 08:32.480
So now what we need to do we need to know we can have it.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.790
We need to add some styles.

08:33.800 --> 08:34.710
The image is there.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.410
It's just one pixel.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.310
So when I'm going to do.

08:37.310 --> 08:44.460
I'm going to add the caption right here we have some text with the title and then just a user.

08:44.620 --> 08:46.070
Sorry it's the topic.

08:46.340 --> 08:53.530
So I'm going to go and create a new section on you and that is going to contain this captions.

08:53.630 --> 08:55.460
So I'm going to say class name.

08:55.790 --> 08:56.440
Close.

08:56.600 --> 09:02.750
And this one is going to be caption class caption but we have to have an age for it if you remember

09:02.750 --> 09:11.810
we added styles for 8:04 this one because we can to use it right now can be item and then topic OK if

09:11.810 --> 09:13.090
we save it.

09:13.660 --> 09:14.050
OK.

09:14.060 --> 09:14.510
Looks nice.

09:14.510 --> 09:18.560
We have Sean Stewart and Stephen on the Sean Simonsen right here.

09:18.740 --> 09:21.890
You know it's kind of a darker night here.

09:21.890 --> 09:27.200
You're not able to see or to see at the time you're going to style it in a minute.

09:27.230 --> 09:30.030
I'm going to say a pea and begin to add the text.

09:30.200 --> 09:37.010
So since we have that information inside of evil again it's an inside a title going to say item that

09:37.070 --> 09:42.730
title you know right here the topic and the title.

09:42.770 --> 09:44.420
So we are getting the data.

09:44.900 --> 09:47.520
So this is working nicely.

09:47.720 --> 09:52.040
It's really really ugly because we need to add our styles to it.

09:52.250 --> 09:56.390
So let's go to the next section and add the styles for the slider.
