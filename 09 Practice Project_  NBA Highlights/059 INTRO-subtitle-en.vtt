WEBVTT

00:01.190 --> 00:04.810
OK so let's start with the second project of this course.

00:04.910 --> 00:06.320
This is what we're going to be building.

00:06.350 --> 00:07.660
We're going to be building this.

00:07.660 --> 00:09.160
Let me just reload the page.

00:09.500 --> 00:14.940
So whenever the page loads we have an NBA Web site and we have a slider right here.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.460
We're going to use a plug in for this.

00:16.460 --> 00:21.480
I'm going to tell them which plug in we can use and whenever we scroll down we have this transition.

00:21.650 --> 00:26.130
And of course if we over which is have an animation and it's a link of course.

00:26.340 --> 00:33.830
And for example if we have a subscribe to section if we subscribe for example whatever and then just

00:33.830 --> 00:39.880
up come is going to save this into a database and it's going to give you a thank you.

00:40.130 --> 00:42.500
So this is pretty much what we can do.

00:42.500 --> 00:46.810
We're going to have a poll right here with will be we will be the next champion.

00:46.970 --> 00:51.590
And if we click on it it's going to just add a vote and everything is going to be again just saved into

00:51.590 --> 00:52.580
the database.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.630
We have an inside section if you go to teams we get a nice transition.

00:56.650 --> 00:59.720
We're going to have a list of all the teams of the NBA.

00:59.810 --> 01:06.990
And if we type 14 a team for example Celtics we can get that Tim can filter everything with ESX.

01:07.160 --> 01:12.650
And if a clear a team is going to take us to an inside page with a description of the team you know

01:12.650 --> 01:18.080
the logo name and just a simple description and we can have all the players all the players are going

01:18.080 --> 01:18.950
to be the same.

01:18.980 --> 01:22.390
We're going to be using a fake API for this.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.110
I'm going to give you all the information.

01:24.110 --> 01:24.950
Don't worry.

01:25.020 --> 01:28.120
And now I want to do this I want to do this in a different way.

01:28.160 --> 01:31.920
I don't want to just show you what to do.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.560
I'm going to give you and you can download you to be able to download as a resource on this lecture.

01:37.600 --> 01:43.100
You're going to have pretty much a document telling saying just specifying what you will need to do

01:43.540 --> 01:45.130
how you will need to do it.

01:45.410 --> 01:50.540
You're going to have the link to this Web site so you can inspect it but pretty much I'm going to give

01:50.540 --> 01:56.890
you all the resources so you can grab them and just tried to do it yourself and not just watch to BDO.

01:57.260 --> 02:01.230
So I'm going to give you this file with the documentation and everything else.

02:01.230 --> 02:06.350
And I'm going to give you a photoshop with all the signs and all the layers with the inside pages and

02:06.350 --> 02:07.070
everything else.

02:07.190 --> 02:10.270
So you can get the images from here or whatever.

02:10.460 --> 02:18.030
If not inside the same folder you're going to have the you can have the images folder right here.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.330
Imported already.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.770
You're going to have the images file there with all the images.

02:21.770 --> 02:26.830
So you don't need to just export from Photoshop because you may not have photoshop.

02:26.840 --> 02:30.080
So I'm just giving you all the files ready right here.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.070
So can going to give you one more thing.

02:32.090 --> 02:33.940
It's going to be the D-B that Jason.

02:34.070 --> 02:38.880
All the information about this about this database is going to be right here.

02:38.900 --> 02:43.750
So we're going to fetch this database and we're going to use Jason's server.

02:43.910 --> 02:45.840
Now we're going to use a bunch of things.

02:45.890 --> 02:51.290
Everything is going to be specified on the documentation that we can use the slider and begin going

02:51.290 --> 02:52.700
to react to slick.

02:52.760 --> 02:56.930
If you come from Jay Corey and Javascript you know this looks like.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.650
Well this is the re-act version for this.

02:59.950 --> 03:02.940
We're going to use the reveal whenever we scroll down.

03:02.940 --> 03:04.130
Just let me show you.

03:05.110 --> 03:10.540
If we scroll down we're going to have the animations right here and we're going to use re-act reveal

03:10.540 --> 03:11.710
for this.

03:11.710 --> 03:14.360
And of course the Jason server.

03:14.800 --> 03:15.220
OK.

03:15.250 --> 03:16.830
So this is fine.

03:16.840 --> 03:21.790
Just download the resource if you want if you wish it were the way you need to download it to get the

03:21.790 --> 03:23.150
images and the DVD.

03:23.160 --> 03:28.580
Jason for the course now on the next few weeks it's going to take a while it's going to take a while.

03:28.670 --> 03:31.950
I'm going to tell you how to build this right from the start.

03:32.020 --> 03:32.360
OK.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.760
We're going to do everything even the styles.

03:35.140 --> 03:35.490
So.

03:35.490 --> 03:36.480
OK.

03:36.820 --> 03:39.020
You will need to do at home.

03:39.190 --> 03:39.880
Just create.

03:39.880 --> 03:40.350
React.

03:40.360 --> 03:40.880
App.

03:41.050 --> 03:41.470
OK.

03:41.650 --> 03:42.870
Whatever name you wish.

03:43.060 --> 03:47.770
And we will only do we will do all the installing for the project on the next section.
