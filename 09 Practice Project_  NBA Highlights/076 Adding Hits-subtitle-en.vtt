00:02.230 --> 00:09.550
OK so whenever we click on an element on a team we are just adding boats and pretty much what we do.

00:09.570 --> 00:14.730
We just click in the elements and begin to just call to a function that is going to enter the database

00:14.730 --> 00:17.830
to this particular team it's going to change the boats.

00:17.940 --> 00:24.330
And then after it's done it's going to do a new network request for all the teams again and it's going

00:24.330 --> 00:28.410
to render with a new state of boats.

00:28.560 --> 00:33.840
So I'm going to go just right here to the item to each item and I'm going to add a function just an

00:33.900 --> 00:35.990
On Click event so we can change it.

00:36.030 --> 00:39.090
Unclick can say unclick is going to be equal.

00:39.180 --> 00:40.990
And then we just trigger function.

00:41.370 --> 00:43.340
So we're going to be calling to function.

00:43.360 --> 00:48.780
And this function is going to be called This is going to be called this at Count.

00:48.840 --> 00:54.510
You know again make sense now this kown dysfunction is going to take two arguments.

00:54.510 --> 00:56.280
We need two arguments.

00:56.280 --> 01:03.660
First it's going to be the amount of counts we have currently currently have with this team that is

01:03.660 --> 01:08.010
going to go to the database is going to search that element is going to grab the counts and is going

01:08.010 --> 01:09.320
to add one.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.790
So that's why we need to count.

01:10.800 --> 01:16.640
We need to add it to either one to save the new amount of boats on the server.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.040
So the first thing we need is going to be the items that count.

01:20.050 --> 01:23.170
So I'm going to say item that count.

01:23.640 --> 01:24.070
Right.

01:24.210 --> 01:30.180
So the second thing we need is going to be the ID of the team so we can change that team directly.

01:30.190 --> 01:34.050
So going to say coma and getting past the I.D. of the team.

01:34.130 --> 01:38.330
So it's going to be item that ID right now.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.840
It's going to be creating this function because we didn't have it right now.

01:42.120 --> 01:47.760
So I got to say I'm going to go right here I'm going to say count and this ad count function is going

01:47.760 --> 01:50.070
to take two arguments.

01:50.080 --> 01:50.880
All right.

01:51.140 --> 01:55.470
It's going to take the count and it's going to take the ID Burguet.

01:56.070 --> 01:57.960
So we need to do a fetch request.

01:57.960 --> 02:05.490
And since this isn't is in rest API the Jasen server we can use patch.

02:05.720 --> 02:06.250
All right.

02:06.450 --> 02:09.870
So I'm going to you are going to fetch for now.

02:09.980 --> 02:16.270
Now this Fetch is going to take a U R L and we have it right here inside localhost and teams.

02:16.290 --> 02:23.850
The thing is is that to access a particular team we need to call it by id and it's going to access just

02:23.850 --> 02:27.350
like this before slash and maybe the ID number two.

02:27.370 --> 02:33.840
So I was going to enter it to the number two team the ID with the number two team with the ID of number

02:33.840 --> 02:35.240
to get.

02:35.580 --> 02:36.800
So I'm going to go right here.

02:36.840 --> 02:44.980
Eric capitis you're all home and I'm just going to set up the location so I can use temporal strings.

02:45.100 --> 02:51.330
That's going to be you are EHLO says we want to access a particular team are going to do for Slash and

02:51.330 --> 02:54.490
then call whatever ID we are getting.

02:54.720 --> 03:00.150
So I'm going to say gee we need to set up we need to set up this fetch.

03:00.150 --> 03:05.000
So the first one is going to be the method and the method method.

03:05.070 --> 03:10.050
Ergo it's going to be patch patch.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.360
Very good.

03:11.460 --> 03:12.980
Next we need to set the headers.

03:12.990 --> 03:18.670
So I'm going to say headers and then just open and close.

03:18.870 --> 03:22.060
The first thing is going to be the except.

03:22.270 --> 03:27.820
So it's Except and this one is going to be application.

03:28.230 --> 03:33.230
Jason so I'm going to ride application for Shlash.

03:33.320 --> 03:38.760
Jason Burguet we're going to do in a coma and we need to set the content type.

03:38.970 --> 03:47.970
So I'm going to say content content and then type and the content type is going to be the same pretty

03:47.970 --> 03:48.540
much.

03:48.750 --> 03:53.570
So I'm going to do this I can copy and paste right.

03:53.580 --> 03:58.840
The next thing is going to be changing the whatever we or something says we need to change the account.

03:58.860 --> 04:05.280
And when you choose to convert it to unstring going to coma and the body of this request is going to

04:05.280 --> 04:09.300
be converted with Jason Dodd stratify.

04:10.110 --> 04:17.750
And now what we need to do we need to pass the counts but it's going to be the count plus one.

04:18.030 --> 04:20.520
So we want to modify the count.

04:20.910 --> 04:27.860
We're going to modify the count and it's going to be equal to count that we have right here this argument.

04:27.990 --> 04:32.280
But this one is going to be equal to count plus one.

04:32.970 --> 04:39.840
We don't need a response for now because the response if you have a server you're not making a network

04:39.900 --> 04:44.130
request to a server that it's going to return whatever you're modifying.

04:44.160 --> 04:49.530
This is good but it's not good for us because we need to change the information right here.

04:50.130 --> 04:55.860
If you're getting this maybe if you get the just the the the data for the team that you're modifying

04:56.190 --> 05:01.840
you can just grab that data go to pull teams search it and just move that.

05:01.950 --> 05:04.790
You know you can do that but you're not going to do that.

05:04.800 --> 05:10.620
So what I'm going to do whenever this is done updating the information on the server I'm going to make

05:10.730 --> 05:15.220
a new network request with this fetch pool and fetch pool.

05:15.250 --> 05:19.410
It's going to go to the server and bring all the information again.

05:19.590 --> 05:27.370
It will set the stage with the new boats state and then it's going to re render with the new information.

05:27.370 --> 05:33.650
So I'm going to go right here the bottom I'm going to say Dot down and grab that callback.

05:33.870 --> 05:41.250
So I'm going to do this open just parenthesis and then just call to the function.

05:41.620 --> 05:45.710
And we're going to say this that fetch Paul back.

05:46.440 --> 05:52.940
So whenever this is done calls fetch poll going to bring the data update the states and then it's going

05:52.940 --> 05:55.290
every rendered data right.

05:55.390 --> 05:59.790
So just go to the genome project and just reload the page.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.810
And if I click in Golden State it should be our date in this.

06:03.890 --> 06:04.220
All right.

06:04.260 --> 06:05.060
So it's working.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.520
Get now.

06:08.540 --> 06:11.890
Now we need to have a conditional but you're not going to do this.

06:11.900 --> 06:14.220
It's a lot of work it's going to take us a lot of time.

06:14.270 --> 06:17.090
We could just click wants to add one.

06:17.090 --> 06:19.460
If it began it's going to just add twice.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.700
You know you could cheat with this.

06:21.750 --> 06:30.110
We can do is just said in the in the on the browser just said something to the local storage saying

06:30.110 --> 06:36.050
that you already bought it and if you did just block it but you're not going to do that we're going

06:36.050 --> 06:43.440
to do something else we're going to go to the next one and the next section to give us time to this.

06:43.430 --> 06:44.870
We're going to make this better.

06:45.080 --> 06:50.270
And then we're going to go to the next section which is going to be the teams section just show the

06:50.270 --> 06:51.980
teams and filter the teams.
