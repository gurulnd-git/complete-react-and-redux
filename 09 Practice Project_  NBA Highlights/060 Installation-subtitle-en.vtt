WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:05.300
OK so let's do all the set up and installing on the for these for this project.

00:05.310 --> 00:12.030
So from the start I have just the idea to create we are ranked AB I deleted pretty much everything just

00:12.030 --> 00:15.330
like we did before and left index as an index.

00:15.330 --> 00:16.400
Not H-G mail.

00:16.560 --> 00:17.760
So just like this.

00:17.850 --> 00:23.970
Now I've created a component's folder inside the source and then inside I had just create an app that

00:23.970 --> 00:26.750
has that is just rendering a hello world.

00:26.790 --> 00:28.480
Just something real simple.

00:28.470 --> 00:29.640
I've added the DVD.

00:29.640 --> 00:37.950
Jason do you have a US resource on the lecture and I've added the images folder so we can just grab

00:37.950 --> 00:39.320
the images from there.

00:39.330 --> 00:39.580
All right.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.440
That's the only thing I did begin to do.

00:41.460 --> 00:42.610
Everything else right now.

00:42.790 --> 00:45.000
We're going to need to install a lot of dependencies.

00:45.090 --> 00:47.260
So this is going to take to get it would take a while.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.660
I'm going to the video of course whenever I install anything so we can to use Jason's server.

00:51.660 --> 00:55.710
You can have the documentation right here.

00:55.800 --> 01:01.680
Basically this Jason's server is just to create a rest API in just a few seconds.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.590
It's literally a few seconds.

01:03.840 --> 01:09.470
So the only thing that the adjacent server or server uses is going to be the DVD Chaisson.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.780
So what we need to do to install it.

01:11.790 --> 01:18.250
If you don't have it if you did it on the previous lecture with the NPM installed mine is Jason's server.

01:18.570 --> 01:20.530
If you didn't do it we can do it now.

01:20.670 --> 01:23.710
It's going to be AM PM NPM.

01:23.730 --> 01:28.960
There we go up NPM install and then we can do minus D minus.

01:28.970 --> 01:31.070
Do you mean Global's global.

01:31.080 --> 01:37.920
So when I install this dependency globally we can just access some commands without doing PM install

01:38.040 --> 01:39.540
and we could just use it.

01:39.540 --> 01:41.660
It's going to be Jasen server.

01:42.260 --> 01:43.720
I'm going to just click enter.

01:44.070 --> 01:45.300
It's going to take a few seconds.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.070
I've already have it installed.

01:47.190 --> 01:50.410
So it's not going to take that long to be possible.

01:50.460 --> 01:51.630
And be right back.

01:52.140 --> 01:52.470
OK.

01:52.470 --> 01:53.500
Everything is ready.

01:53.520 --> 01:57.570
I'm going to open a new terminal because we need to right here on this terminal.

01:57.650 --> 02:00.950
We're going to run the NPM start for the re-act project.

02:00.990 --> 02:07.290
So we need a new terminal and run this Jason server on a different and different shell on different

02:07.290 --> 02:07.860
place.

02:08.070 --> 02:16.180
So to use to run the adjacent server we're going to say Jason server and then space and we're going

02:16.180 --> 02:18.120
to we're going to do minus minus.

02:18.260 --> 02:21.960
Watch that space and we're going to make reference to the file.

02:22.000 --> 02:22.790
I gave you.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.540
It's going to be divi done.

02:24.550 --> 02:26.320
Jason right.

02:26.370 --> 02:28.250
We need to specify the port.

02:28.360 --> 02:33.790
So we're going to be running everything inside port 3 0 0 4.

02:33.850 --> 02:36.210
You can choose whenever you want.

02:36.230 --> 02:37.760
They're going to click enter.

02:37.780 --> 02:38.870
It's going to do some stuff.

02:38.920 --> 02:44.080
And it's really fast and then it's going to give you is going to give you just a message going to say

02:44.080 --> 02:48.560
everything is ready and we load the DVD and Jason everything is done right.

02:48.580 --> 02:50.280
So you can have some resources.

02:50.320 --> 02:57.310
So if I just copy this inside this location you can have the Jasons going to just up give us.

02:57.380 --> 02:59.270
Jason's just like a fake.

02:59.340 --> 03:01.100
It's just like a rest API.

03:01.270 --> 03:10.600
So if I go to no home right here and I go home is going to give us the Jason so we can fetch the information

03:10.600 --> 03:11.920
right here and use it.

03:12.290 --> 03:12.880
OK.

03:13.120 --> 03:13.540
That's fine.

03:13.540 --> 03:15.350
That's the first step.

03:15.370 --> 03:18.210
I'm going to go back to the first terminal.

03:18.220 --> 03:18.860
Right.

03:18.910 --> 03:22.090
So we have installed we installed these in server.

03:22.190 --> 03:24.680
What else we can see we are going to be using routes.

03:24.700 --> 03:36.480
So we need to install reac router and get to say NPM install install and then re-act dash router dash

03:36.870 --> 03:45.280
Dom and we're going to use the person for Dot Z zero dot zero and then minus minus save.

03:45.850 --> 03:46.230
OK.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.480
It's going to take a few seconds and we'll be right back.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.210
OK so the router it's installed.

03:53.270 --> 03:54.230
What else we can need.

03:54.230 --> 03:58.320
We're going to need something to do this transition.

03:58.340 --> 04:00.080
This actually is going to be a slider.

04:00.260 --> 04:01.460
So we have some options.

04:01.460 --> 04:07.410
We have a lot of options just like when we use Jay Querrey we have a lot of light libraries to do this.

04:07.430 --> 04:13.870
Well this is the same idea you can have to use the re-act slick if you know the slick slider for Jay

04:13.870 --> 04:16.550
Querrey Well this is the re-act version.

04:16.610 --> 04:17.570
Same idea.

04:17.760 --> 04:22.650
So two solid beginning solid i've already have installed but I'm going to sit on it anyways.

04:22.790 --> 04:31.210
It's going to be NPM install and then it's going to be called re-act then dash and slick and going to

04:31.210 --> 04:31.400
do.

04:31.410 --> 04:33.720
Minus minus safe of course.

04:34.190 --> 04:34.710
OK.

04:34.840 --> 04:36.170
It's going to take a couple minutes.

04:36.180 --> 04:36.970
I'll be right back.

04:40.160 --> 04:47.870
OK so the reveal it installed whenever we just scroll down on the web page you're going to have this

04:47.930 --> 04:48.830
transition.

04:49.040 --> 04:54.410
So when you begin to use something else for this it's going to be called re-act reveal.

04:54.710 --> 05:02.420
And again just like the reveal from Jay Carney we just the same idea which is scroll and whenever the

05:02.420 --> 05:06.610
element appears on the screen it's just going to do a transition.

05:06.620 --> 05:09.540
So this re-act reveal uses two things.

05:09.550 --> 05:14.360
It uses the dependency for react with reveal and uses an animate CSSA.

05:14.510 --> 05:19.070
So whenever you install We need to install both and then we need to to use both.

05:19.070 --> 05:23.450
Don't worry we going to I'm going to tell you how to use this so we can install this.

05:23.540 --> 05:30.470
So it is going to be NPM install than space re-act dash reveal.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.660
That's the first thing.

05:31.850 --> 05:32.860
And then begin to be done.

05:32.870 --> 05:33.910
And he made CSSA.

05:33.950 --> 05:43.100
So we are going to do animate dot see SS and then of course mine is mine is safe right click enter and

05:43.100 --> 05:45.330
it's going to take a few seconds and I'll be right back.

05:47.150 --> 05:54.470
OK so whenever on the on the actual project whenever I go to teams we can have this nice transition

05:54.560 --> 05:57.920
this fading transition.

05:57.920 --> 06:03.050
And of course if we change again we're going to have to see the same transition but maybe you're going

06:03.050 --> 06:05.740
to be using a successor group for this.

06:05.870 --> 06:09.920
So we will need to install that dependency for the transition group.

06:09.950 --> 06:22.210
I'm going to say NPM install and install and then react dash transmission and dash group right.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.750
We're going to use the version 1.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.930
So it's going to be one dot X and then we're going to do.

06:26.930 --> 06:29.010
Mine is mine is safe.

06:29.040 --> 06:35.160
It could enter it's going to take a few seconds and again I'll be right back OK.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.330
We are almost done.

06:36.390 --> 06:39.500
We need to install redux because we can use redux.

06:39.510 --> 06:40.560
And this project.

06:40.560 --> 06:45.320
So we are going to do NPM Oh no I'm sorry this is not the speaking for the use Windows.

06:45.450 --> 06:48.000
So everything is ready right now.

06:48.060 --> 06:51.180
We're just going to start building the first component.

06:51.180 --> 06:54.180
So let's go to the next section and start building this.
