WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:06.240
OK so let's start creating this components are going to reload the page.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.180
I'm just going to show you what we have.

00:08.370 --> 00:14.140
And if I scroll down it's just going to do that tiny animation and pretty much what we have.

00:14.160 --> 00:17.700
It's just an image and a text that's going to be a link.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.850
So it's something really really simple.

00:20.880 --> 00:25.980
If you think about it really only two elements for this or three if you count the key which is going

00:25.980 --> 00:27.020
to be the ID.

00:27.440 --> 00:28.800
It's not really really hard.

00:28.920 --> 00:34.890
So let's go to the right here to the DVD that Jason let's check what data we have for this.

00:35.010 --> 00:41.100
If we go to the home right here to the home you can have the slider and then you have something that

00:41.100 --> 00:43.920
it's going to be called blocks inside blocks.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.170
We have an ID for each element.

00:46.170 --> 00:48.500
You can have a type and the type.

00:48.500 --> 00:52.610
It's going to be the the class that we're going to append right here.

00:52.620 --> 00:58.090
So if this this element is going to be LG which is large it's going to be of course large.

00:58.110 --> 00:59.670
We're going to add a class for this.

00:59.820 --> 01:05.450
If it's M.D which is medium you can have the medium and if it's small you can have small size.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.450
You can set pretty much everything.

01:07.470 --> 01:12.420
The hard work right here is going to be from the C Ss you're going to do all the animations and everything

01:12.420 --> 01:14.590
else directly from CSSA.

01:14.910 --> 01:16.700
So what else do we have we have the image.

01:16.750 --> 01:20.430
OK so that it's inside the folder images folder.

01:20.590 --> 01:24.130
You can have a title and you can have a link Whenever we just click on this.

01:24.180 --> 01:27.080
It's going to should be taking us to a new section.

01:27.180 --> 01:29.490
You're not going to do that of course.

01:29.520 --> 01:29.810
OK.

01:29.850 --> 01:33.400
So let's start building this interest closer to the Jason.

01:33.630 --> 01:34.860
I'm going to go to home.

01:35.170 --> 01:37.700
So is this going to be a new section.

01:37.710 --> 01:39.340
I'm going to create a new component.

01:39.360 --> 01:45.970
I'm going to say import export and import blocks.

01:45.990 --> 01:53.170
I'm going to call it blocks from and then just dart for Slash and blocks get.

01:53.310 --> 01:54.530
We didn't have that component.

01:54.570 --> 01:58.560
Let's go to the components folder and create one for this.

01:58.620 --> 02:01.110
It's going to be blocks non-jazz

02:04.040 --> 02:04.630
block.

02:04.670 --> 02:06.950
Let's make it blocks.

02:07.340 --> 02:14.700
So I'm going to go two blocks and I'm going to start creating all the things that we bring here so you

02:14.710 --> 02:15.860
can start small.

02:15.860 --> 02:23.780
You're going to import react react from react.

02:23.900 --> 02:24.230
Right.

02:24.230 --> 02:29.560
So this component is just going to handle the image and link.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.480
So we didn't need a class component.

02:31.550 --> 02:38.000
So I'm going to bring components from here I'm going to go right here and I'm going to create the component

02:38.000 --> 02:38.570
for this.

02:38.570 --> 02:45.260
So it's going to be Kunst and blocks this blocks is going to receive some data.

02:45.260 --> 02:52.790
So we will just create a function and this component is going to receive some prompts.

02:52.970 --> 02:55.560
So we have returned some jazz acts.

02:55.760 --> 03:01.450
And for now we're going to just return blocks so we can make sure that everything is working blocks

03:01.560 --> 03:04.750
that we need to make this component available.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.540
So I'm going to say export default.

03:07.790 --> 03:10.390
And then just blocks.

03:10.760 --> 03:11.370
Right.

03:11.660 --> 03:17.670
So going to go to Home says we have it right here going to go to the bottom to the render.

03:17.840 --> 03:25.070
And I'm going to go and just call the blocks right there go to our application reload the page and we

03:25.070 --> 03:25.990
get blocks.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.540
So get it working now.

03:28.590 --> 03:34.910
The blocks component is going to receive the data we have on the Jason database so we can create the

03:34.910 --> 03:35.670
components.

03:35.750 --> 03:40.000
So we need to pass some prompts just like we did with the slides.

03:40.370 --> 03:45.780
So the information of this is going to be inside this that state that home.

03:45.830 --> 03:48.320
Remember if you go to the Jason.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.470
Everything is going to be on their home.

03:50.570 --> 03:52.900
And we have the slider and then the blocks.

03:52.910 --> 04:01.070
So what we can do we can pass prompts this that stayed at home that blocks just like we did before.

04:01.280 --> 04:08.600
So I'm going to call the call this prompts blocks know access and so.

04:08.760 --> 04:17.310
I'm going to pass this that stayed home that blocks Burguet.

04:17.510 --> 04:22.370
So if I go to here and cons lock locks can the prompts.

04:22.370 --> 04:26.950
You should be getting that data to say prompts here.

04:26.960 --> 04:34.170
Just check the council I have right here and we get the props.

04:34.570 --> 04:35.450
So we get the blocks.

04:35.470 --> 04:35.950
That's good.

04:35.950 --> 04:39.960
So we have the data so we can loop this and create what we want.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.510
We're going to close for now and I'm going to go back right here two blocks.

04:43.660 --> 04:46.710
So OK so now this blocks is going to receive some prompts.

04:46.930 --> 04:49.430
So I'm going to just delete the console log.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.760
You know we don't need it.

04:51.190 --> 04:57.400
And inside blogs are going to call to a function that is going to iterate over the list over the Jason

04:57.730 --> 05:01.310
and just return the blocks that.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.400
So I'm going to call a function.

05:03.640 --> 05:13.070
I'm going kind of ask because we already did this many many times and it called generated and then blocks.

05:13.300 --> 05:20.080
So this one is going to pass some props which is the actual data we have right to add a class name to

05:20.080 --> 05:20.410
this.

05:20.410 --> 05:26.800
It's going to be class name and the class name is going to be home blocks.

05:26.910 --> 05:35.720
Right right here the top you can create a function that is going to grab this prompts and just do something.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.320
Now I'm going to do this for now.

05:37.450 --> 05:40.900
Konst and call the generate blocks.

05:40.900 --> 05:46.260
This one is going to receive some prompts of course and then it's going to run a function.

05:46.270 --> 05:52.190
Now what we can begin to loop is going to be whatever it's inside prompts that blocks.

05:52.210 --> 05:58.890
So what we can do we can use destructuring and access blocks directly right.

05:58.930 --> 06:05.320
Since whenever this component loads and loads of blocks and so it prompts is going to be empty.

06:05.350 --> 06:12.250
We need to add a conditional that is going to check if we have data and if we do get it run the map.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.940
Now there is a different thing right now.

06:15.460 --> 06:19.460
Whenever we go we're here just reload the page from the top.

06:19.690 --> 06:23.230
And if I just scroll down we have this tiny animation.

06:23.410 --> 06:29.580
This animation is going to be handled not entirely by us is going to be.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.760
It's going to what we're going to use re-act reveal.

06:31.780 --> 06:40.390
Remember we install this so the reac reveal is going to use two main things they reveal from from re-act

06:40.390 --> 06:45.630
reveal and then it uses some success to do some animations.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.030
So what we need to do we need to add this right here.

06:49.210 --> 06:49.620
Right.

06:49.630 --> 06:56.950
So just get a copy of this I'm going to say important reveal from Briac reveal and then just animate

06:57.040 --> 06:59.990
that CSSA and just delete this.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.680
Now we're going to use more and more thing.

07:01.750 --> 07:04.670
This may just make it smaller.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.730
This this Elon's right here.

07:08.730 --> 07:09.690
It's going to be a link.

07:09.810 --> 07:12.700
So we need to use link from re-act router.

07:12.700 --> 07:17.070
So I'm going to import it right now so we can have it available in just a couple minutes.

07:17.210 --> 07:22.040
I say import link from and then just react.

07:22.060 --> 07:27.410
Router Dom get that's fine.

07:27.560 --> 07:28.760
So now what do we need to do.

07:28.790 --> 07:32.830
We need to grab this blocks and we need to map over it.

07:33.110 --> 07:34.700
So we're going to start right now.

07:34.730 --> 07:38.020
I'm going to say return beginning at.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.080
We're going to start.

07:39.220 --> 07:39.550
I'm sorry.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.880
Enter two blocks.

07:40.990 --> 07:45.280
And we're going to map right.

07:45.410 --> 07:53.570
So this map is going to take an item on each iteration and then it's going to just run a function right.

07:53.630 --> 07:58.310
So this on each iteration we want to return some jazz acts.

07:58.360 --> 08:03.330
So I'm going to say return and we will add all the code inside return.

08:03.770 --> 08:05.470
You know this.

08:05.570 --> 08:14.120
So now whenever we use a dependency just like this we need to wrap everything inside the reveal that

08:14.120 --> 08:15.410
we are bringing right here.

08:15.440 --> 08:21.310
So if you check right here going to have reveal and then just the effect that we want to get.

08:21.320 --> 08:25.220
So I'm going to go right here and create a reveal right here.

08:25.250 --> 08:31.920
It's going to copy write so we say we we'll open close.

08:32.040 --> 08:39.190
Sorry let's go back and just reveal right.

08:39.390 --> 08:45.360
So inside reveal whatever we put right here whatever code we put right here is going to just trigger

08:45.420 --> 08:46.740
an animation.

08:46.740 --> 08:51.990
Now the animation that begin to use and you can have just a list of all the animations right here if

08:51.990 --> 08:57.290
you go to the documentation going to use something that is going to be effective and that is the prompt

08:57.290 --> 08:59.760
that we need to pass to reveal.

08:59.760 --> 09:06.140
So it's going to be a fact and the fact first starts out as animated.

09:06.210 --> 09:07.330
That's the first one.

09:07.470 --> 09:12.580
And then we need to set to specify which kind of animation you want to use.

09:12.600 --> 09:16.410
So it's going to be phased in up.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.420
And this enemy can comes from any inmate that's ISIS.

09:20.430 --> 09:26.970
If you just read the documentation you have a link where you can see the different right here different

09:27.120 --> 09:29.660
types of animations that you can get.

09:29.790 --> 09:32.650
You have bounce you have whatever you can have.

09:32.660 --> 09:35.330
A lot of animations.

09:35.390 --> 09:36.890
Let's get.

09:36.920 --> 09:40.580
So let me just go back to go back to the project.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.490
Right.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.290
So we want to just triggered this with the effect.

09:44.320 --> 09:49.110
Now each reveal is going to just have a key scene.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.600
We are mapping overhead.

09:50.800 --> 09:58.360
The act is going to ask us to give a key says the key is going to be inside item that Id say item that

09:58.590 --> 09:59.780
I.D..

10:00.000 --> 10:06.770
Now just check I'm going to add some dummy text and run this and see what we are getting.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.510
So it's going to working.

10:10.920 --> 10:16.200
So now what we need to do we need to ride pretty much everything else right here.

10:16.380 --> 10:22.500
And the problem is that for example like it's all before you can have different types of widths for

10:22.500 --> 10:23.270
each block.

10:23.490 --> 10:29.820
And we need to bring this to the from the database and just put the classes right here.

10:29.970 --> 10:33.390
Let's go to the next section because this one went along and just do that.
