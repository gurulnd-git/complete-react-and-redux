WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:02.520
OK so let's add some styles.

00:02.580 --> 00:06.370
So I'm going to go to styles and I'm going to go to teams.

00:06.400 --> 00:10.340
You know I want to create a new one that is going to be just team right.

00:10.690 --> 00:12.510
It's going to be team.

00:12.960 --> 00:17.300
And when you add the style so I'm going to start with the team data wrapper.

00:17.460 --> 00:19.540
I believe I call it like that.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.180
Team data wrapper.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.180
Yeah I did.

00:22.470 --> 00:26.140
So going to make reference to that element is going to be a class.

00:26.160 --> 00:33.000
So we do dart team data wrapper so we're going to use flex again for this you know because it's easier.

00:33.410 --> 00:35.090
We're going to use flex.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.590
It's going to be display flex OK.

00:39.790 --> 00:40.940
So what is next.

00:40.990 --> 00:43.380
We going to have a left and a side.

00:43.450 --> 00:44.920
Of course on the left and right.

00:45.130 --> 00:51.940
So going to make reference again to the same elements and again to call the DOT the left and then just

00:51.940 --> 01:01.780
close it right the left is going to have a box sizing of borderer box and we can add some padding to

01:01.780 --> 01:01.990
it.

01:02.020 --> 01:12.880
So it's going to be panning and begin at 10 from top and bottom and 20 for the science that's at the

01:12.880 --> 01:17.380
Stiles for the right one can say instead of left can you change it to.

01:17.380 --> 01:18.400
Right.

01:18.670 --> 01:21.280
So the right the right one is going to just grow.

01:21.280 --> 01:26.560
You know this one is going to be kind of a with a fixed width with images inside with image inside.

01:26.800 --> 01:31.520
And then the right one is going to stretch with the remaining space.

01:31.540 --> 01:42.720
So we want to be flex grow and one so we can use box sizing and box sizing is going to be border box.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.350
We're going to add a border left.

01:45.370 --> 01:54.220
So it's going to be border and just left and the board the left is going to have one pixel solid and

01:54.330 --> 01:56.090
hashtag benign.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.800
Benign benign is a nice way.

02:00.030 --> 02:00.340
OK.

02:00.370 --> 02:05.250
We're going to add a padding and the padding is going to be zero pixels and then 20 pixels from the

02:05.250 --> 02:06.750
side.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.850
Right now looks nice but we need to trim this image.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.430
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and again to make reference to the left container and then

02:16.430 --> 02:23.450
to the image that we have inside OK we can add a width of one hundred and fifty and 50 pixels something

02:23.450 --> 02:29.830
small OK that's good looks nice you know still is still big.

02:30.230 --> 02:36.280
So OK let's add some stylings to each one.

02:36.330 --> 02:42.450
Now you can go right here at the bottom and just to make sure because you know we should be getting

02:42.480 --> 02:43.380
this in a different way.

02:43.400 --> 02:50.670
Oh that's why we're getting this container this big big container because the image on the Alattar it's

02:50.760 --> 02:51.700
really really big.

02:51.810 --> 02:55.330
That's why Letwin let's just keep moving forward.

02:55.470 --> 02:58.090
Let's add some stylings to the H-1 stack.

02:58.320 --> 03:01.160
We're going to say team data.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.820
And I believe it was Team data wrapper.

03:05.850 --> 03:08.250
Yep team data rubber have it right here.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.970
And we're going to make reference to the H-1 and we can change just a color.

03:13.150 --> 03:14.150
It's going to be hashed.

03:14.340 --> 03:18.540
And then 6 the 60 60.

03:18.720 --> 03:26.500
Again just a nice gray What else let's give some styling to this want you know the Squats are going

03:26.500 --> 03:30.900
to be floating just kind of you know income comes.

03:31.050 --> 03:38.890
So we're going to use flex for this to say team data and it going to access this quite OK.

03:38.940 --> 03:43.740
So the squad is going to be this play and begin to do flex.

03:43.740 --> 03:45.510
We want to flex direction.

03:45.540 --> 03:47.140
So it's going to be flex direction.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.230
And then just Roe and we need to flex.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.120
Rap.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.150
Rap.

03:55.370 --> 03:56.020
OK.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.570
Now I need to make more changes.

03:59.940 --> 04:00.540
What else.

04:00.570 --> 04:06.990
We have the item I'm going to just trim the image for this because it's kind of annoying me.

04:07.190 --> 04:15.060
I can say a team against Team data wrapper of course and the team data wrapper to access the squad just

04:15.060 --> 04:16.570
like before.

04:16.890 --> 04:25.710
Dot squad and we access the item and we get to access the EMG Takk and the EMG attack.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.650
It's just going to have some slim

04:31.750 --> 04:32.280
size.

04:32.320 --> 04:32.600
Okay.

04:32.650 --> 04:35.060
That's much better.

04:35.110 --> 04:43.450
So I'm going to just display block of course and it's going to be margin to zero out all that's good.

04:43.810 --> 04:46.550
So let's go and just keep moving with the squat.

04:46.990 --> 04:53.690
So we would grab each item and we can just float him to make the items really small make me.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.320
Let me just make the speaker Okay.

04:56.680 --> 05:03.480
So I to make reference to Team data and squat and I'm going to access the item inside.

05:03.670 --> 05:04.880
Right.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.160
Let me just make this better.

05:06.210 --> 05:06.980
Good.

05:07.130 --> 05:07.770
So OK.

05:07.780 --> 05:13.270
Inside each item begin to make it position relative.

05:13.580 --> 05:19.250
And we're going to set a width of 25 percent so it's going to be 4 per.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.520
Yeah that's good that's good.

05:20.710 --> 05:21.450
That's the idea.

05:21.460 --> 05:22.930
Four on each.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.350
OK.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.170
It's going to be overflow.

05:26.170 --> 05:31.510
Hidden Rigaud padding of tiny pixels.

05:31.570 --> 05:36.760
What's next it's going to be baulks sizing and just pour the box right.

05:38.530 --> 05:40.020
You know looks nice.

05:41.520 --> 05:41.980
OK.

05:42.160 --> 05:42.880
What else.

05:43.030 --> 05:47.370
We have the item we need to style the 8:04 inside.

05:47.410 --> 05:54.550
So I'm going to make reference to item an opening close and I'm going to just select the 8 right inside

05:54.550 --> 06:01.810
the page are going to make everything text align and center and then just color and we can put a nice

06:01.810 --> 06:07.930
nice kind of a bluish color 0 0 6 B.V. 6

06:11.280 --> 06:12.070
looks nice.

06:12.230 --> 06:12.720
OK.

06:13.050 --> 06:14.310
So what is next.

06:14.310 --> 06:18.540
We have the image the style the notes right here inside.

06:18.690 --> 06:22.800
So again pick up make reference to the item we're almost on.

06:22.900 --> 06:31.440
I'm going to say Dot node and begin to select the font size to 14 pixels and then padding and padding

06:31.440 --> 06:35.880
is going to be four pixels and then zero from the sides.

06:35.880 --> 06:36.120
Right.

06:36.120 --> 06:36.510
What else.

06:36.510 --> 06:39.210
We have a span inside you know this one.

06:39.510 --> 06:48.710
So ever again just select everything opening close and then just make reference to this pattern OK.

06:48.770 --> 06:51.790
You begin to kind of make it bigger.

06:51.910 --> 06:55.870
Kind of in a bold way bold style.

06:55.890 --> 07:00.980
So I'm going to say font weight and it's going to be 600.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.200
Using Rebozo.

07:02.260 --> 07:04.200
So it's going to grab it from there.

07:04.920 --> 07:05.240
All right.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.020
So everything looks nice.

07:07.020 --> 07:09.300
Let's see if that nothing's broken.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.470
I love the page the slider.

07:11.490 --> 07:12.660
It's working.

07:12.660 --> 07:17.970
If I go to subscribe to us well you're getting the transitions if I go to start to us.

07:17.970 --> 07:21.920
I'm going to say whatever Jamail to come for Antar.

07:22.050 --> 07:22.620
Thank you.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.140
And then goes away.

07:24.350 --> 07:25.320
It works.

07:25.380 --> 07:34.560
If I type whatever we get the are nice What else if I just click and Golden State is going to add the

07:34.560 --> 07:37.260
boats and whatever.

07:37.260 --> 07:38.870
More votes for next.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.520
OK we get the fruiterer's.

07:40.510 --> 07:43.500
Everything is going to go to teams.

07:43.660 --> 07:46.070
We get the transitions and all the teams.

07:46.470 --> 07:53.330
If I search for Celltex works next right.

07:53.370 --> 07:57.130
If I read everything everything goes back to the original state.

07:57.140 --> 08:00.640
If I click can Celtics we get the data right.

08:01.170 --> 08:04.210
So it's working everything it's working just nice.

08:04.230 --> 08:10.620
Remember you can go to get have and just clone the entire project everything the finished project is

08:10.620 --> 08:14.850
going to be just right there so you can download it and inspect it.

08:14.910 --> 08:19.530
If you have a problem building something it just let me know we just can check to get half and just

08:19.530 --> 08:21.240
match the differences.

08:21.510 --> 08:22.000
OK.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.090
So this is good.

08:23.110 --> 08:24.000
We're done with this.

08:24.120 --> 08:28.360
Let's go to the next section and start with redux.

08:28.380 --> 08:30.080
That one is going to be really nice.

08:30.090 --> 08:36.270
It's going to be again just long because relax it's hard to understand at the beginning.

08:36.360 --> 08:39.600
But once you get it it just works like a charm.

08:39.600 --> 08:44.190
There is no more just component will and then just creating the effect right there.

08:44.230 --> 08:48.670
We're going to do it on a different way and use something better for this.
