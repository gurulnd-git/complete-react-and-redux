WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:04.400
Create the components that it's going to contain all teams.

00:04.440 --> 00:06.520
So OK I'm going to go right here.

00:06.530 --> 00:12.900
And first we need to get a team to do create a component that it's going to host all the teams.

00:12.900 --> 00:20.170
So I'm going to say import and then just teams from and then teams.

00:20.210 --> 00:23.900
No we didn't have this component we're going to create it in a second.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.620
We need to set a route for this.

00:25.830 --> 00:31.860
So I'm going to say route and the route is going to be exact and we can have a path for this.

00:31.860 --> 00:38.100
Of course the path is going to be teams and we're going to use a component whenever we call to this

00:38.400 --> 00:47.070
route that is going to be component equals two teams and then we just close it right using teams with

00:47.070 --> 00:49.410
a capital T.

00:49.470 --> 00:50.700
Let me just change it.

00:50.710 --> 00:51.690
Good.

00:51.960 --> 00:57.340
So now what need do we need to create this component and this component is going to do a lot of things.

00:57.360 --> 01:03.210
So it's going to be a class based component going to go right here to components and are going to create

01:04.140 --> 01:07.210
a team teams component teams now.

01:07.250 --> 01:09.670
JS Right.

01:09.930 --> 01:17.550
So again since this is a class based component we're going to bring a lot of things are going to import

01:18.660 --> 01:29.770
react and then just component from re-act component and it's going to be from react.

01:29.770 --> 01:32.650
Now we're going to use a few things each image.

01:32.910 --> 01:34.460
Each team is going to be a link.

01:34.620 --> 01:41.640
So I'm going to go right ahead and just import link from re-act router link right.

01:41.740 --> 01:45.020
It's going to be from and then just react.

01:45.700 --> 01:49.370
Router dong do.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.550
No no.

01:50.580 --> 01:51.290
OK.

01:51.780 --> 01:53.650
We're going to use US rescissions group.

01:53.720 --> 02:03.160
So I'm going to import it and they're going to say C Ss and then transmission and then grew up.

02:03.420 --> 02:04.490
Grow up.

02:04.560 --> 02:05.420
Very good.

02:05.730 --> 02:16.570
And it's going to be from an again react Dorsch transmission dodge and grew up OK.

02:16.590 --> 02:18.360
So this should be right.

02:18.630 --> 02:23.670
Now let's create the class that's going to be a class and the name is going to have is going to be teams

02:24.110 --> 02:28.290
is going to extend the component.

02:29.490 --> 02:30.490
OK.

02:31.020 --> 02:35.410
Now what we need to do we need to call to a render method is going to be rendered.

02:35.630 --> 02:39.540
And inside the render we can return some GSX.

02:39.540 --> 02:47.450
So for now we're going to put it Dave that sits teams and says we need to make this component available.

02:47.520 --> 02:56.810
So I'm going to say export than default and then teams sorry and reload the page.

02:57.150 --> 02:58.460
And in theory you should be working.

02:58.460 --> 03:01.270
If I go to teams we get teams get.

03:01.290 --> 03:02.380
So that is good.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.160
So what is the first thing that we need to do.

03:04.170 --> 03:06.920
We need to at least render something right here.

03:07.200 --> 03:13.510
So I'm going to go right here to the component and I'm going to start creating this.

03:13.630 --> 03:14.750
This elements.

03:14.790 --> 03:22.740
So first the class name the main wrapper is going to be teams components.

03:22.980 --> 03:28.170
Now this steam component is going to have an input to go to here we have an input.

03:28.240 --> 03:31.520
OK so I'm going to create a wrapper for the input.

03:31.710 --> 03:42.220
So it's going to be dev that the class name equals to no team teams input from start.

03:42.270 --> 03:44.640
This input is going to have.

03:44.670 --> 03:52.140
This container is going to have an input and it's going to be type and then just text and then we just

03:52.320 --> 03:52.980
close the.

03:53.030 --> 03:55.560
Of course then we can add more things.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.670
I'm going to add the placeholder right now.

03:57.750 --> 04:00.160
Can you just bring that bring this down.

04:00.210 --> 04:03.800
And then just right here you can add placeholder.

04:03.900 --> 04:14.130
And this is going to be equal to search for for a team and we're going to do that one.

04:14.140 --> 04:15.700
OK let's get.

04:16.050 --> 04:23.910
And then after the impled you can have a container div that's going to it's going to contain all the

04:23.910 --> 04:24.450
teams.

04:24.460 --> 04:29.920
So I'm going to say class name equal to teams container.

04:30.420 --> 04:33.060
Again makes sense right here.

04:33.080 --> 04:37.890
You can have a list of teams and we need to do a lot of things first.

04:38.280 --> 04:42.720
The first thing the first thing that we need to do is that since this is a class component and begin

04:42.720 --> 04:48.330
to use the state I'm going to bring the constructor and the constructor is going to receive some prompts.

04:48.510 --> 04:55.580
And then again inside we can have the super props write this constructor.

04:55.590 --> 04:57.760
This component is going to have a state.

04:57.930 --> 05:04.800
So I'm going to say this that state calls to something or whatever the application loads we want to

05:05.190 --> 05:07.460
run inside a component.

05:07.500 --> 05:12.390
We're going out we're going to run a fetch that is going to grab the list of all the teams and whenever

05:12.390 --> 05:18.840
we get the list we can save them inside a state and the state is going to be teams.

05:19.260 --> 05:27.210
Since this is an array we're going to just start as an empty array get the next one whenever we filter

05:27.300 --> 05:32.780
the teams we want to grab that list of all the teams as reference.

05:32.780 --> 05:39.420
We want to filter and get maybe one for example if I say Celtic is going to Filcher and get one as a

05:39.420 --> 05:40.170
result.

05:40.170 --> 05:49.830
So we will grab this result and put that result inside a different state and teams get stays on mutated

05:50.190 --> 05:53.800
so we can say for it right.

05:53.980 --> 05:57.150
It is one again just empty array.

05:57.150 --> 06:03.930
Now whenever we type write something right here this component is going to be a control component so

06:03.990 --> 06:09.300
we can just pass we can to use the value for the inputs through react and through state.

06:09.390 --> 06:12.160
So I'm going to say keyboard's.

06:12.630 --> 06:13.950
So we did this many times.

06:13.950 --> 06:16.960
That's why I'm going a little bit fast.

06:17.040 --> 06:17.750
OK.

06:18.060 --> 06:22.860
So why do we need to do now we need to fetch the list of teams right.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.850
Because it's the first thing we eat before we get started.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.920
So I'm going to call this component

06:31.250 --> 06:37.410
component and then just didn't mount that mount.

06:37.740 --> 06:42.860
And after this gets triggered begin to do the fetch says we need.

06:42.870 --> 06:51.060
And you were able to do the fetch you once you created a verbal right here that is going to host all

06:51.060 --> 06:55.320
the you or else it's going to host a lot of teams.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.500
Of course it's going to be teams.

06:58.540 --> 06:59.110
There you go.

06:59.400 --> 07:05.980
And the URL in my case is going to be a local host three thousand five and then just teams that are

07:06.000 --> 07:08.310
going to do a fetch just like we did before.

07:08.310 --> 07:17.450
Same idea is going to say fetch and fetch is going to have a you're just going to be this you are l.

07:17.510 --> 07:23.260
So I'm going to copy and paste Burguet for now not doing nothing you say.

07:23.350 --> 07:24.590
I'm going fast.

07:24.830 --> 07:31.460
So we have a method and the method is going to be get get.

07:31.640 --> 07:36.590
Now whenever we we fetch this we want to grab our response from the body.

07:36.720 --> 07:41.770
I'm going to say then something is moving the furniture in a nice time to do it.

07:41.810 --> 07:47.050
It's going to say then and then just responds with a response.

07:47.090 --> 07:50.440
Of course we can get around that response and convert it.

07:50.510 --> 07:57.580
Convert everything to Jaison whenever we get this states on we want to run a callback.

07:57.710 --> 08:01.140
So it's going to be then and then just open close.

08:01.170 --> 08:05.810
We use Jaison we're going to run the callback right here.

08:06.460 --> 08:06.960
OK.

08:07.130 --> 08:08.230
So this is good.

08:08.330 --> 08:10.780
We know how to do this but did this many times.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.970
Now what is going to happen whenever we get the information from the Jason we want to store in the state

08:17.420 --> 08:24.560
the state of teams which is going to be equal to all the teams and then filtered into host went to save

08:25.010 --> 08:26.960
all the teams inside fizzer.

08:27.050 --> 08:33.050
So whatever the application loads is going to grab the filters as an argument can loop the filtered

08:33.380 --> 08:35.100
and it's going to show all the teams.

08:35.180 --> 08:41.100
That is what's going happen on the first on the first loading when the app loads.

08:41.300 --> 08:44.480
Then if you do something else we've changed as we want.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.320
Grab the teams that contains all the teams.

08:47.700 --> 08:51.030
You know this is to not to make a new network quest.

08:51.150 --> 08:57.320
You grab the list of all the teams with flittered and we store it inside Filcher and now the application

08:57.320 --> 09:02.460
is going to render is going to grab maybe just one or two teams we have inside filtered it is going

09:02.460 --> 09:07.810
to show the new state right since we need to set state is going to say this.

09:07.820 --> 09:16.880
That said state and inside said state you want to set state of teams equal to Jaison and that the set

09:16.880 --> 09:23.300
of the Filcher going to be altered and is going to be equal to Jason which is pretty much the whole

09:23.300 --> 09:23.940
list.

09:24.750 --> 09:31.380
All right so now we get to need to show something a list we are going to be using the CSSA from sessions

09:31.380 --> 09:33.000
group but not for now.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.260
I'm just going to render a list just to make sure that everything is working fine.

09:37.470 --> 09:42.330
So I'm going to open and close and right here we want to bring the list.

09:42.510 --> 09:50.430
So I'm going to say render list this list is going to grab this state as arguments.

09:50.550 --> 09:52.910
So we're going to say this in that state.

09:53.610 --> 09:58.660
OK so I'm going to go right here and create a function that is going to loop this list.

09:58.750 --> 10:04.650
So I'm going to say Wunderlist is one is going to be equal to a function.

10:04.650 --> 10:09.360
This function is going to grab the state as an argument and the data we want.

10:09.390 --> 10:10.900
It's going to be inside filtered.

10:11.070 --> 10:15.830
So we're going to use destructuring and call the filter.

10:16.740 --> 10:23.030
Nice you know get get you're going fast if you can't understand everything I'm doing.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.390
Congratulations.

10:24.390 --> 10:28.920
So I'm going to say return and we want to return whenever we want to filter.

10:29.040 --> 10:37.080
So we're going to call to have map so we can say filtered Dionte map and inside the map of course we

10:37.080 --> 10:42.200
pass an item and we run an anonymous function.

10:43.190 --> 10:52.410
OK we want to return some GSX of course and whenever we return the GSX we want to return a link you

10:52.470 --> 10:53.550
know each image.

10:53.550 --> 11:01.030
Each team is going to go to a place so say two equal to and open close.

11:01.550 --> 11:08.040
OK so one second find it it's video went along.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.140
So let's go to the next section and just continue with this map.
