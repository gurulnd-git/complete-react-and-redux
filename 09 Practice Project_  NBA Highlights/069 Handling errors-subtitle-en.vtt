WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:06.060
OK so now we to show some messages whenever the users sense something formation.

00:06.220 --> 00:11.740
So from start I'm going to go right here to the state whenever we send information.

00:11.750 --> 00:16.510
If everything is good you want to show a message that is going to say thank you.

00:16.510 --> 00:21.560
And if it's not good is going to say something that something like like check your e-mail in red.

00:21.740 --> 00:27.070
So we're going to go back to the project and since we want to handled this through to or through the

00:27.070 --> 00:29.950
state we need to set some states.

00:29.950 --> 00:35.200
Now whenever the user sends the information you can have a default state and it's going to say error

00:35.260 --> 00:36.490
or success.

00:36.610 --> 00:40.930
And if there is an error this error state is going to change to two.

00:41.180 --> 00:46.850
And whenever it's changed to true you're going to show something right here just on show.

00:46.850 --> 00:51.660
Let's set the state first right here so we can have a second state.

00:51.670 --> 00:58.740
It's going to be error error and this one whenever the application loads is going to be false.

00:59.050 --> 01:05.000
And then if everything everything just goes OK you can have one for success.

01:05.200 --> 01:09.580
So it's going to be success and this one again is going to be false.

01:09.650 --> 01:13.150
So whenever the application loads it's not going to show any any messages.

01:13.150 --> 01:14.450
We don't want that.

01:14.630 --> 01:20.740
So I'm going to go right here to the Rander and I'm going to write something that a few don't know if

01:20.740 --> 01:25.390
you know about tertiary is going to just kind of look a little bit weird.

01:25.510 --> 01:27.530
So we're going to go below the impact.

01:27.970 --> 01:33.880
And I'm just going to try and if this device is going to have the check your e-mails going can have

01:33.880 --> 01:35.890
the error message the bad message.

01:35.950 --> 01:39.080
You say check your e-mail.

01:39.450 --> 01:40.240
Right.

01:40.420 --> 01:44.000
This Dev is going to have a class name.

01:44.290 --> 01:50.320
And now what we need to do we need to assign a class name of error to this but we want to show it whenever

01:50.320 --> 01:51.430
we want.

01:51.790 --> 01:56.290
So what we need to do right here we need to do a conditional that is going to be checking the whole

01:56.290 --> 01:56.950
time.

01:56.950 --> 02:03.730
If that does that state that error is true or false whenever the rehang renders the application is going

02:03.730 --> 02:04.290
to check.

02:04.470 --> 02:06.350
And if it's good it's not going to show it.

02:06.370 --> 02:08.530
But if it's bad it's going to show it.

02:08.590 --> 02:14.380
So I'm going to First Call the state that we need to check since this one is going to be the error.

02:14.500 --> 02:19.990
Again to say this dot state DOT error.

02:20.340 --> 02:20.750
Right.

02:20.770 --> 02:22.570
That's the first thing.

02:22.570 --> 02:25.570
Now we're going to use tertiary to check this eternity.

02:25.660 --> 02:29.300
It's just like an if statement but everything is going to be in line.

02:29.530 --> 02:34.390
So whenever we use tourney first we pass the thing that we want to check if we want to check state or

02:34.510 --> 02:35.820
we just leave that.

02:35.860 --> 02:38.740
Now what we do we put a question mark right here.

02:39.220 --> 02:46.000
And if everything goes right and passes is true it means that the state that error it's true is going

02:46.000 --> 02:50.440
to show the error message begin to change the class because we are inside class.

02:50.950 --> 02:55.690
But if everything goes the other way you want to show something else.

02:55.700 --> 02:56.090
All right.

02:56.100 --> 02:59.600
So pretty much if this is true we showed this one.

02:59.620 --> 03:05.550
But if it's false we show this one said the class for the error is going to be error.

03:05.770 --> 03:06.350
All right.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.860
So if it's true we want to show it.

03:08.890 --> 03:10.080
And this one is true.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.040
So we want to say show that to me.

03:14.310 --> 03:21.350
If the statement is true we will add a class to this component to this death that is going to be error.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.300
That show.

03:22.730 --> 03:28.280
But if it's false you want to just give a class of error.

03:29.860 --> 03:35.060
Now the thing is that whenever the application loads scenes we add some classes to this.

03:35.140 --> 03:37.070
It's going to show it whatever.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.430
If it's bad or good it just can show it.

03:39.580 --> 03:40.870
I'm going to do the other one.

03:40.900 --> 03:41.670
Thank you.

03:41.820 --> 03:45.970
And it's pretty much the same idea but the opposite to the opposite.

03:46.270 --> 03:47.460
So it's going to be a death.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.840
It's going to say just thank you.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.720
Right.

03:50.830 --> 03:51.820
We need a class name.

03:51.820 --> 03:56.130
So it's going to be class name and this one is going to be called.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.800
It's going to be using attorney.

03:58.120 --> 04:03.490
So what we need to check right here is going to be that this state that success is going to get this

04:03.940 --> 04:07.040
that state doesn't success.

04:07.240 --> 04:07.890
Right.

04:07.930 --> 04:10.200
And again as we use the question mark.

04:10.390 --> 04:14.740
And if it's true we want to show the success we want to show.

04:14.730 --> 04:15.490
Thank you.

04:15.670 --> 04:22.850
So I was going to say the class is going to be success and then we want to add the show so it's can

04:22.870 --> 04:24.180
show that thank you.

04:24.250 --> 04:32.590
And if it's not right we want to just say success at success.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.670
Right.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.480
So now looks get.

04:35.620 --> 04:40.410
Now I'm going to go to the CSSA right here because right now it's going to just show it all.

04:40.510 --> 04:43.030
So when you hide it to hide it all.

04:43.120 --> 04:43.510
OK.

04:43.510 --> 04:48.850
So whenever the application starts this ones are not going to show they're going to go to the Stiles

04:48.910 --> 04:55.410
that's the SS just on the closest style he says I'm going to go right here at the bottom and we will

04:55.520 --> 05:00.700
never start writing the the code the styles for this crimes.

05:00.730 --> 05:08.440
So I'm going to say fine now what we want to do we want to use the subscribe panel erimus just so I'm

05:08.440 --> 05:15.430
going to call the parent class which is going to be subscribed and then panel when they go to the comput

05:15.430 --> 05:18.840
and and just make sure that this crime panel.

05:18.850 --> 05:24.300
So it's got that I go now we want to call the error.

05:24.750 --> 05:28.880
And if it's there what we want to do we want to show it.

05:29.110 --> 05:29.760
OK.

05:30.300 --> 05:33.550
It's the same one for the other one says we're going to have just two classes.

05:33.550 --> 05:38.900
I'm just going to copy everything and just paste it but this one is going to be success.

05:39.270 --> 05:40.890
Success.

05:41.630 --> 05:42.710
OK.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.000
And do this just going to put it right here.

05:46.050 --> 05:50.730
So if this one is show the Erse get to the show class.

05:50.730 --> 05:54.470
We want to this send this play to block.

05:54.870 --> 05:55.690
Very good.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.430
Now we need to write some other classes and go right here.

05:59.430 --> 06:04.480
Going to make reference to this crank panel and now what we need to do is to set up the error that's

06:04.530 --> 06:11.390
going to say error get this one is going to start always with the display of none.

06:12.270 --> 06:14.710
And we're going to have a caller that it's red.

06:14.790 --> 06:15.980
It's a nice read.

06:16.020 --> 06:18.160
Not just regular red.

06:18.180 --> 06:22.310
It's going to be EF 4 4 3 3 6 right.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.740
So now we need to do pretty much the same thing with thank you.

06:25.920 --> 06:31.290
So I'm going to just copy paste it right here I'm going to say success.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.070
There's one again.

06:32.070 --> 06:33.620
It's going to be this button on.

06:33.890 --> 06:36.180
But it just put a green instead.

06:36.300 --> 06:40.210
So this for C A F 5 0 set.

06:40.350 --> 06:46.590
Just a nice screen and with the application starts we are not going to see we're not going to get this.

06:46.590 --> 06:52.510
So now what do we need to do is we need to change the state whenever the users submit this.

06:52.560 --> 06:59.200
And if everything is good right here we can set the States we want to just handle this so.

06:59.210 --> 06:59.820
OK.

07:00.180 --> 07:03.830
So first I'm going to go right here and set the errors.

07:03.930 --> 07:09.110
So if everything goes bad if we just enter a text and e-mail it's incorrect.

07:09.330 --> 07:12.370
We want to set the state of error to do so.

07:12.390 --> 07:12.930
OK.

07:13.060 --> 07:22.360
We're going to say this that said stayed begin to grab this error and say and just change it to true.

07:24.340 --> 07:24.910
Right.

07:25.180 --> 07:25.550
OK.

07:25.630 --> 07:26.350
Let's get.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.360
So let's check it right now.

07:28.360 --> 07:32.920
I'm going to just type something and if I click enter we get check your e-mail.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.870
So that's good.

07:34.070 --> 07:35.140
I mean just reload the page.

07:35.140 --> 07:37.040
So it's it's working.

07:37.060 --> 07:38.700
We're going to have a problem in just a minute.

07:38.770 --> 07:41.790
I'm going to just let you know how to fix it.

07:41.790 --> 07:42.250
So OK.

07:42.280 --> 07:49.930
Now since we want to whenever we submit something and it's saved into the database we need to change

07:49.930 --> 07:51.830
the success to try again.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.300
So I'm going to go right here.

07:53.530 --> 07:59.440
And since we want to show in her message whenever everything it's whenever this is sent we get the call

07:59.440 --> 08:00.420
back right here.

08:00.490 --> 08:06.270
We want to call this success and we will say true right.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.840
So let's check it out.

08:07.840 --> 08:08.990
Got to go right here.

08:08.990 --> 08:16.700
I'm going to type whatever at gmail dot com and then I'm going to click enter and we get thank you.

08:16.700 --> 08:17.240
All right.

08:17.440 --> 08:18.580
So it's working.

08:18.580 --> 08:22.370
Now the problem is that you're saving the database we're calling the.

08:22.540 --> 08:25.500
But this message stays the same.

08:25.540 --> 08:31.310
So we kind of need to create a function that is going to just clear the messages is going to just change

08:31.350 --> 08:35.240
states of error and success to false.

08:35.510 --> 08:35.980
OK.

08:36.040 --> 08:39.470
So we want to do this every time we do Handels of men.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.060
You know if it's good it's going to do this.

08:42.130 --> 08:46.860
And at the end we want to change the state back to false.

08:46.900 --> 08:47.260
Right.

08:47.380 --> 08:48.380
It's going to go right here.

08:48.470 --> 08:54.430
I'm going to call to a function that it's going to run after a few seconds so I'm going to say this

08:54.550 --> 08:57.850
doesn't clear clear.

08:57.940 --> 09:04.860
And then man messages on that just make it right.

09:05.050 --> 09:06.330
There we go.

09:06.340 --> 09:09.120
So this function what it's going to do.

09:09.160 --> 09:13.450
It's going to just run said time out after three seconds.

09:13.460 --> 09:18.820
It's going to wait three three seconds and it's going to change the state of error and success back

09:18.820 --> 09:19.440
to false.

09:19.630 --> 09:22.810
And then it's just going to show it's going to hide the elements.

09:23.140 --> 09:27.130
So ok going to go right here and just create dysfunction.

09:27.220 --> 09:30.490
This one is going to be a clear messages.

09:30.490 --> 09:31.000
This one.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.830
It's not going to receive any any prompts.

09:34.990 --> 09:39.200
So I'm going to say just like this just can create a function.

09:39.210 --> 09:41.540
It doesn't matter.

09:41.620 --> 09:49.960
So now we need to do a set time out and do set time out right these say time out.

09:49.990 --> 09:55.660
The first argument that it's going to take it's a function I'm going to say function then open and close

09:56.170 --> 09:58.790
and begin going to do the change is state right here.

09:58.810 --> 10:03.400
The second argument of said time out is going to be the amount of time that it's going to wait.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.710
So we're going to say three seconds.

10:05.740 --> 10:12.670
Three thousand write the code that begin to run here is going to be changing the state of success an

10:12.670 --> 10:14.380
error that we have right here.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.970
Back to false.

10:16.330 --> 10:26.170
So we say this Dodd said state and we pass an object and we get what we're going to have it's going

10:26.170 --> 10:33.340
to be error back to false and then success back to false.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.280
Right.

10:34.420 --> 10:35.180
So that's get.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.730
This should be working.

10:36.730 --> 10:45.950
So I'm going to reload the page and I'm going to go right here and say Frances at gmail dot com enter.

10:46.340 --> 10:47.620
We get thank you.

10:47.620 --> 10:51.350
She'd be clearing up but it's not going to work.

10:51.430 --> 10:58.130
We're going to get an error message and this is good because whenever we call to a function inside set

10:58.390 --> 11:06.850
a timeout out and we say does this means set time out and not the class you know we need to change this

11:07.450 --> 11:08.870
we need to make reference to this.

11:08.890 --> 11:15.040
And this is going to be related to the structure to this class and now the time out because of course

11:15.040 --> 11:17.150
we don't have a state on said time out.

11:17.170 --> 11:23.960
So the way we do this is we go to the end of the function and we use that mind we use set going can

11:23.960 --> 11:32.950
say dot and then bind and inside the bind we say this so whenever we are saying we are using the bind

11:32.980 --> 11:35.740
and there's we are saying OK you just run this function.

11:35.890 --> 11:42.880
But whenever we said this inside function is going to be the class and not the the set time out or whatever.

11:42.880 --> 11:50.380
So if I just again reload the page and go right here and again type Francis at gmail dot com going to

11:50.380 --> 11:51.130
click enter.

11:51.220 --> 11:52.510
I'm going to say thank you.

11:52.660 --> 11:54.190
And it should be pillaring.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.900
And it's it's it's it's doing that.

11:57.070 --> 11:59.530
I'm going to type some whatever.

11:59.530 --> 12:02.550
Check your e-mail and it's gone.

12:02.590 --> 12:03.040
All right.

12:03.100 --> 12:06.380
So everything it's working as expected.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.770
So this is pretty much done.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.480
You can have of course code going to have.

12:11.710 --> 12:14.440
So what are we going to do on the next to the next lecture.

12:14.440 --> 12:18.340
Next video is going to be styling this just giving styles to this.
