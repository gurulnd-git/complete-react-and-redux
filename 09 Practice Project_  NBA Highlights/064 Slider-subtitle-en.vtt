WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:03.040
OK so let's start building the home.

00:03.120 --> 00:06.880
So whenever we the page loads we can have a lot of components.

00:06.960 --> 00:11.760
You can have the component that it's going to just handle this slider.

00:11.910 --> 00:18.180
You can have a different component component to handle the subscriber's then one to render the blocks

00:18.380 --> 00:20.200
and then one for the poll.

00:20.420 --> 00:25.200
OK let's get now we can i need to create different components going to start with this one.

00:25.260 --> 00:27.080
I'm going to call it feature to component.

00:27.120 --> 00:30.090
You know just like it like or press a featured image.

00:30.390 --> 00:34.260
So again so we need to create a component that is going to be featured.

00:34.380 --> 00:38.120
And now this component whatever we information we get.

00:38.130 --> 00:45.090
You know the text the title you're going to get it from the Jason files from the API.

00:45.120 --> 00:52.170
So if I go to the adjacent file we have right here we're going to have to have a data whenever the this

00:52.170 --> 00:52.790
is starts.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.380
You can have a home and the bit inside you can have a slider.

00:56.520 --> 01:00.410
You can have the information that you're going to use on the blocks and everything else.

01:00.510 --> 01:06.570
So what we can do whenever this component's loads we can bring in the data we can fetch the data from

01:06.570 --> 01:13.140
the API and then pass the information we want to each component right here on the slider.

01:13.260 --> 01:19.210
You can use just the information that is inside the slider so we can pass that prompts.

01:19.530 --> 01:21.550
OK so let's start with this.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.810
So OK so I'm going to need to bring a component.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.690
It's going to be the featured component.

01:27.690 --> 01:28.550
We don't have it yet.

01:28.580 --> 01:30.030
We're going to create it in a minute.

01:30.180 --> 01:38.100
So I'm going to say components components and then it's going to say import and we can import that component

01:38.340 --> 01:40.820
and I'm going to call it featured.

01:40.950 --> 01:41.390
Right.

01:41.520 --> 01:45.480
So it's going to be from then dot dot for Slash.

01:45.570 --> 01:49.200
And we didn't have it yet but it's going to be called featured.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.090
Right.

01:50.190 --> 01:50.770
Let's get.

01:50.950 --> 01:55.140
So let's go to the components and create this feature components.

01:55.470 --> 02:03.150
So I'm going to create a new file and it's going to be called featured as inside the feature that you're

02:03.150 --> 02:04.500
not going to have anything.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.180
And this one is going to be just a stateless component.

02:08.310 --> 02:14.370
So I'm going to just copy this and paste it and we're going to get rid of the components can go right

02:14.370 --> 02:14.750
here.

02:14.790 --> 02:19.450
I'm going to say Konst and I know how are we going to call it.

02:19.470 --> 02:25.430
It's called a feature that's good featured and begin to say equal.

02:25.470 --> 02:26.400
And what are we going to do.

02:26.480 --> 02:32.780
It received a prompts the prompts are going to be that data that we need to put inside the slider.

02:32.820 --> 02:40.810
So I'm going to say prop's right and we're going to return some GSX so we can skip an error message.

02:40.890 --> 02:45.910
That's when I say return and Dev and slider.

02:46.740 --> 02:50.650
And of course we need to make this available this feature inside home.

02:50.850 --> 03:01.500
So I'm going to say export default and then just a feature right and we go back to home and back to

03:01.530 --> 03:09.080
our project and what we can do we can to make reference to this featured elements we have right here.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.540
So give the lead home nego right here at the bottom.

03:12.660 --> 03:16.810
And again just call this feature that components we are importing.

03:17.160 --> 03:23.460
So I'm going to say featured open close every page we get sliders so it's good.

03:23.550 --> 03:25.490
It's importing this correctly.

03:25.620 --> 03:31.830
Now what we need to do we need to fetch the information after this component the home it's rendered.

03:32.070 --> 03:38.850
So just like before we can to use components that mount to fetch the information whenever this is rendered

03:38.970 --> 03:44.690
will trigger the component amount we will fetch the information for any information from the data server

03:45.060 --> 03:50.190
and we will just add the data we receive to the state.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.780
Build the state first.

03:51.840 --> 03:59.070
I'm going to say constructor and the constructor is going to have some props and then inside we can

03:59.070 --> 04:08.310
have a state since we have a state we need to call super write I say prompts and we can create this

04:08.490 --> 04:12.180
data state equal to an object.

04:12.180 --> 04:18.690
Now first we're going to store inside Home older data we are getting from the from the API.

04:18.870 --> 04:23.620
So whenever the application starts this home is going to be just empty.

04:23.920 --> 04:30.300
I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going I'm going to fetch this information we need so

04:30.300 --> 04:40.360
we can use fetch going to say component sorry components and begin to use the debt mount OK.

04:40.770 --> 04:48.120
So whenever the component mounts after the component mounts we can do the fetch some going to save fetch

04:48.960 --> 04:50.690
and just open and close.

04:50.820 --> 04:58.110
We will need a u r l to fetch this information and this this information is going to be stored in home.

04:58.110 --> 05:05.260
Let's go to the terminal and just check the the routing for this going to go to the Jason server whatever

05:05.280 --> 05:10.760
whatever we started the Jason server and we have right here the home resource.

05:10.770 --> 05:15.040
So I just going a copy of this and close it.

05:15.470 --> 05:18.890
Now I'm going to go right here at the top and I'm going to create a viable.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.010
It's going to be Konst.

05:20.160 --> 05:25.200
And then just you are l home and we can get the the the resource from there.

05:25.350 --> 05:28.650
Can I do this and just paste the address.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.910
That's the location we can fetch it from there.

05:31.920 --> 05:37.170
Of course it's going to give us in our message because we need to just do the settings right here.

05:37.320 --> 05:44.790
So I'm going to go at the bottom and begin to pass your L home as a valid location.

05:44.830 --> 05:48.020
We need to set up the method and the method is going to be good.

05:48.060 --> 05:56.880
So I'm going to say method and the method is going to be get Breguet.

05:56.880 --> 06:01.310
Now whenever we fetch some information we need to grab the Jason.

06:01.320 --> 06:10.720
So we say then and we grab the response and then we just convert everything from Jason.

06:10.740 --> 06:15.390
Jason responds that Jason but did this previously.

06:15.390 --> 06:19.970
Whenever we get this information we need to add it to the to the state.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.310
When you changed state.

06:21.420 --> 06:24.950
So I'm going to say Dan and create a callback for this.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.790
It's going to be Jason we're going to grab that.

06:26.790 --> 06:28.680
Jason we get.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.170
And then going to just run the callback.

06:32.280 --> 06:41.790
Now if I'm just going to do a log and get the Jason just check if the Jason is getting here correctly

06:42.270 --> 06:47.660
he's going to reload the page and bring the console going to go to console.

06:47.770 --> 06:49.720
OK we have an object right here.

06:50.010 --> 06:55.300
And the object is going to be blocks pole and slider is going to be all the elements from home.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.050
So now what are we going to do.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.290
Grab this.

06:58.290 --> 07:00.310
This Jason File.

07:00.500 --> 07:08.600
Begin to put it in the state and assign it home and whenever we called feature we can pass slider.

07:09.030 --> 07:12.130
OK we can slide up a slider as pop.

07:12.240 --> 07:12.430
OK.

07:12.480 --> 07:12.880
Let's get.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.090
That's what we can do.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.570
Going to bring this down.

07:16.080 --> 07:16.390
OK.

07:16.470 --> 07:24.060
So since we want to set state what we do is this dart set state open close.

07:24.330 --> 07:28.050
And since it's an object we're going to just open it.

07:28.050 --> 07:31.320
Do the caller braces we want to change the home.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.310
So I'm going to say home.

07:33.710 --> 07:34.230
OK.

07:34.380 --> 07:37.500
And the new data is going to be inside Jason.

07:37.500 --> 07:37.900
Right.

07:37.920 --> 07:42.690
So now the state of home is going to have all the information.

07:42.690 --> 07:47.910
So now what we need to do we need to pass it as props when we make this better.

07:48.180 --> 07:53.850
So we're going to go to feature and we get to create a prop that is going to be called slides and the

07:53.850 --> 07:57.110
slides is going to contain this.

07:57.150 --> 08:00.310
That state DOT home.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.170
And if you remember is going to be inside slider.

08:03.210 --> 08:06.410
So I'm going to say slider.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.020
All right.

08:07.300 --> 08:13.930
So if I go to featured this go to feature and we are whenever this featured It's called from here is

08:13.970 --> 08:19.130
going to pass all the data and the feature is going to receive it inside prompts.

08:19.240 --> 08:23.960
So if I go right here and console log and then prop's

08:27.060 --> 08:34.490
and every other page and bring the inspect and it comes along and the first time that it the app the

08:34.510 --> 08:35.260
compound loads.

08:35.260 --> 08:36.690
Of course we get nothing.

08:36.750 --> 08:41.410
And after it's mounted it's going to do the request update the state and then it's passing it.

08:41.410 --> 08:43.820
So we get it inside slides.

08:44.050 --> 08:46.150
Let's get OK.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.760
So on the next section we're going to go to the next section.

08:48.850 --> 08:55.810
Going to grab this props and show all the information and we're going to make use of the re-act slick.

08:55.830 --> 08:58.080
You can read the documentation first.

08:58.110 --> 09:00.270
We're begin to use a couple of things.

09:00.270 --> 09:01.190
Begin to use this one.

09:01.190 --> 09:06.550
And of course we need to do some settings just like a regular plugging for example with Jay Querrey

09:06.780 --> 09:07.800
same idea.

09:07.860 --> 09:11.370
So let's go to the next section and create the slider.
