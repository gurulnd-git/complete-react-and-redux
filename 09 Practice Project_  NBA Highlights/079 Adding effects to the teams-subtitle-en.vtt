WEBVTT

00:01.860 --> 00:03.830
OK so let's keep going this.

00:03.870 --> 00:05.350
I'm sorry I had to stop it.

00:05.440 --> 00:10.500
The video went along and I think my neighbor was having a fight outside my door.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.410
And I think he has a drinking problem sorry for that.

00:13.410 --> 00:15.330
Don't tell anybody.

00:15.330 --> 00:17.570
So OK let's keep going with this.

00:17.750 --> 00:23.010
Are going to have a link and right here we need to kind of set the route for this.

00:23.010 --> 00:25.700
So this one is going to be just like this.

00:25.810 --> 00:29.660
They're going to have for Slash and we can go to teams.

00:29.950 --> 00:33.790
It's going to be go to team actually Singler and then forward slash.

00:33.900 --> 00:39.990
And what we need to do is to pass the the item name you know the name of the team.

00:40.020 --> 00:42.890
If I go to Celtic I hear teams Celtic.

00:43.020 --> 00:44.290
So we don't get to go.

00:44.410 --> 00:48.370
We're going to use the idea that we're going to use the name of the team.

00:48.570 --> 00:52.440
So it's going to be teams and then item name.

00:52.980 --> 00:53.470
Right.

00:53.630 --> 00:55.550
With each iteration we need a key.

00:55.550 --> 01:02.850
So I'm going to say key and then item doesn't Id use the ID we're going to have a class so it's going

01:02.850 --> 01:10.550
to be class name and the class name is going to be a team item team item.

01:10.980 --> 01:12.990
Now let me make a wrap.

01:12.990 --> 01:13.440
OK.

01:13.560 --> 01:17.030
So with each team we can have an image right here.

01:17.160 --> 01:24.000
So I'm going to create an image tag and image that is going to have an alt and the old is going to be

01:24.570 --> 01:26.760
item that name right.

01:26.910 --> 01:28.030
You can have a source.

01:28.080 --> 01:31.420
And of course the source you can to use template strings to do this.

01:31.470 --> 01:40.890
And again it's going to be images for Slash then teams for Slash and then just the name of the logo

01:40.940 --> 01:43.450
is going to be item that logo.

01:43.830 --> 01:47.140
And then of course we close the image.

01:47.400 --> 01:52.300
So if we reload the page you're going to get a list of all the teams going to be really really ugly.

01:52.430 --> 01:55.540
You know let's get now to show this.

01:55.530 --> 02:01.410
We're going to use CSSA transition group so I'm going to go right here at the bottom and create the

02:01.410 --> 02:02.370
tag for this.

02:02.370 --> 02:05.570
We've imported this at the top right here.

02:05.760 --> 02:14.190
So we can make use of it and we'll go and wrap everything inside CSSA transition's group by open and

02:14.190 --> 02:15.330
close virga.

02:15.460 --> 02:19.450
We're going to put the list of teams inside.

02:19.740 --> 02:25.080
So now whenever i just render this I'm going to get an error and handle rejection.

02:25.080 --> 02:29.800
The thing is that with CSSA transitions group we need to set to put some SENEX.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.780
So what I'm going to do I'm going to put the settings inside of our will.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.060
So I'm going to say that dot dot dot.

02:36.270 --> 02:43.110
And the name of my animation is going to be fade and then just on the animation.

02:43.690 --> 02:48.960
Now I'm going to go right here the top and just create the settings for this animation.

02:48.960 --> 02:53.910
So I'm going to say Konst and then Faid animation.

02:54.030 --> 03:00.150
This is going to be equal to what we need to do first when you transition name it's going to be transition

03:00.450 --> 03:07.550
and then name and this one it's going to be Fate Yeah but right.

03:07.740 --> 03:12.290
So which we need to set three different types of animation.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.160
We need the transitional peer.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.030
OK.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.110
And what else do we need.

03:18.450 --> 03:22.360
We need to transition Pyr decision enter and the transition bellyfull course.

03:22.500 --> 03:29.290
So it's going to be transition then appear and the transition appear we're going to set it to True.

03:29.740 --> 03:31.480
Then we need to set the time out of this.

03:31.590 --> 03:41.330
So I'm just going to copy paste and set timeout right and the time out I'm going to use 500 for this.

03:41.330 --> 03:43.520
The next one is going to be the transition.

03:43.530 --> 03:44.090
Enter.

03:44.190 --> 03:51.720
So I'm going to say transition and then enter and then over again it can be true and we need to set

03:51.720 --> 03:58.340
the time out so I'm going to copy paste and set time out right.

03:58.380 --> 04:00.940
That time out again 500.

04:00.940 --> 04:01.400
Very good.

04:01.470 --> 04:04.230
Time out.

04:04.240 --> 04:04.650
Good.

04:04.710 --> 04:07.600
I'll do the same thing but this time.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.510
Very good.

04:08.940 --> 04:10.650
So again we need one more.

04:10.650 --> 04:15.750
It's going to be the transitional leave so I'm going to say transition and then leave.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.760
And this one is going to be true.

04:18.120 --> 04:24.950
And then we need to set the time out so we're just going to copy paste and time out.

04:24.960 --> 04:29.230
Burguet is going to be 500 Right.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.780
Right from the start it's going to work.

04:30.780 --> 04:33.800
But you know we're not going to get that the this effect.

04:33.810 --> 04:35.370
We need to add some CSSA.

04:35.490 --> 04:38.080
So I'm going to go to the styles and begin to do it now.

04:38.180 --> 04:42.260
I'm going to add the the settings for this for this faith animation.

04:42.330 --> 04:47.660
So if you go and you can just go ahead and and copy it from get help going to do it right here.

04:48.030 --> 04:49.470
So it's going to be first.

04:49.500 --> 04:53.750
It's going to be the fade and then appear and the fade appear.

04:53.790 --> 04:59.170
It's going to start with an opacity of zero dot 0 1.

04:59.230 --> 05:04.650
Now we have the fate appear and the fate appear active.

05:04.810 --> 05:14.590
So I was going to say Faid appear dot Faid appear Dorsch active and this one is going to be in a city

05:14.980 --> 05:19.780
of 1 0 1 and we need to create transmission.

05:19.810 --> 05:21.420
So it is going to be a transition.

05:21.610 --> 05:27.060
And then it's going to say we're going to grant the opacity we have right here and we can do the transition

05:27.060 --> 05:27.620
for that.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.020
It's going to be half second.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.310
So it's 500 milliseconds.

05:32.300 --> 05:38.690
Now if we do this or we do this it's the same thing you know.

05:38.990 --> 05:49.220
So it's going to be dot 5 0 5 and then just as like it and we can use is in.

05:49.310 --> 05:49.920
Right.

05:50.630 --> 05:54.470
So this is the first thing.

05:54.860 --> 05:56.300
So let's do the other ones.

05:56.300 --> 05:58.380
In theory it should be working.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.380
I know it's not working.

05:59.420 --> 06:00.970
Let's check it out.

06:01.070 --> 06:04.380
Transition appear it's going to be fade.

06:04.610 --> 06:06.450
So everything looks nice.

06:06.470 --> 06:07.530
Time out.

06:07.750 --> 06:12.200
If you made a mistake let's just continue with this and then I'll just check what's going on.

06:12.210 --> 06:17.950
You're going to have the Faid answer Oh no sorry it's fine.

06:17.960 --> 06:23.320
It's going to have it we're going to use just the fade answer because this items are not on the render

06:23.350 --> 06:26.440
day are just entering after we do the fetch.

06:26.460 --> 06:30.200
So we're going to do the same thing going to set the opacity for fate.

06:30.230 --> 06:39.120
Enter And then we need to set the capacity for Faid enter active so active.

06:39.860 --> 06:42.320
And now again the capacity is going to be one.

06:42.330 --> 06:45.640
I'm just going to copy off this and paste it right here.

06:46.920 --> 06:51.390
You know we already did this which is Titian's.

06:51.450 --> 06:53.230
OK so that's fine.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.220
Let's do the Fed the Fed leave.

06:55.450 --> 06:59.250
It's going to be fade and then just leave.

07:00.550 --> 07:09.410
And with the fatefully you've been just again a passerby one.

07:10.090 --> 07:14.140
And then we just put the faith leave active.

07:14.200 --> 07:14.600
All right.

07:14.730 --> 07:16.300
Fade leave.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.020
And then just active good

07:22.420 --> 07:23.040
active.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.500
I know same idea.

07:26.600 --> 07:32.180
I'm just going to copy all of this and paste it right here and now I've noticed I made a mistake right

07:32.180 --> 07:33.940
here on the faith enter active.

07:33.970 --> 07:38.740
I didn't set the capacity and the capacity is going to be one OK he's going to show it.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.140
Whenever we go to enter.

07:41.180 --> 07:42.530
So there you go.

07:42.560 --> 07:45.150
We have the transition.

07:45.620 --> 07:48.940
So if I just reload the page the items are entering.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.950
So it's working but it's good again.

07:52.040 --> 07:52.990
Nice.

07:53.210 --> 08:02.330
So now what we need to do we need to set them to go to the teams right go so what we need to do whenever

08:02.330 --> 08:08.050
we type something on the screen we need to make this Filcher functioning right now.

08:08.150 --> 08:11.410
So let's go to the next section and do the filtering for now.
