WEBVTT

00:01.830 --> 00:03.810
OK so let's add the filter.

00:03.810 --> 00:08.120
So I'm going to just slow down just a little bit because this one is can you.

00:08.340 --> 00:14.750
So whenever we just type something on the input we want to go run a function.

00:14.760 --> 00:20.190
This function is going to check the teams it's going to try to find one and whenever it's finding one

00:20.430 --> 00:23.060
is just going to change the state of filtered.

00:23.410 --> 00:23.720
OK.

00:23.730 --> 00:27.430
So first set we want this component to be a control component.

00:27.570 --> 00:32.540
So the whatever value we type inside it's going to be handled by react.

00:32.730 --> 00:38.680
So we need to set a value to use the state of keyword.

00:38.880 --> 00:46.680
So I'm going to say value equal to this dot state and right here we have the keyboard.

00:46.740 --> 00:47.250
OK.

00:47.450 --> 00:51.680
So I'm going to say Dot and keyword right.

00:51.720 --> 00:59.850
So whenever we type something right here we need to trigger onchange listener listener and run a function

00:59.880 --> 01:05.550
that it's going to just search for a team that's going to go right here the bottom and I'm going to

01:05.550 --> 01:09.420
call to an on Change event change.

01:09.420 --> 01:10.250
Very good.

01:10.740 --> 01:16.060
So the change is going to run a function it's going to pass an event and so we can say like this with

01:16.860 --> 01:24.000
if we use a function that it's going to be just a nerve function and then just something in our front

01:24.000 --> 01:29.730
room is going to be called search term search term.

01:29.730 --> 01:31.230
So what do we need to do right now.

01:31.230 --> 01:35.330
We need to pass the event whenever we just do something right here.

01:35.610 --> 01:42.270
So if I pass the event right here what we can do instead of putting this inside a parenthesis since

01:42.270 --> 01:49.290
we have only one arguments you can skip the parenthesis and we run a function and we pass the event

01:49.950 --> 01:50.880
right.

01:50.880 --> 01:55.450
Search team do it dry team.

01:55.570 --> 01:59.940
OK so now we need to call to this function to create this function.

02:00.270 --> 02:01.330
So let's go right here.

02:01.350 --> 02:07.020
On top of the rental list and we're going to just create the function.

02:07.020 --> 02:10.230
This function is going to take an event.

02:10.230 --> 02:16.060
So I going to say events and then just run the function right.

02:16.110 --> 02:23.100
So now we what we need to do from the event of the input we need to grab the value.

02:23.100 --> 02:28.030
So we have access to the values inside the event that target that value.

02:28.200 --> 02:33.270
So I'm going to create a viable that is going to host this keyboard and say a keyboard.

02:33.420 --> 02:38.610
Now this is going to be equal to event that target

02:41.180 --> 02:42.850
dot value.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.580
Right.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.540
So we get the keyword right there.

02:46.870 --> 02:52.790
So the Council of the keyboard just to make sure that everything works fine is going to say keyboard

02:54.260 --> 02:58.110
and I'm just going to reload the page open the console.

02:58.130 --> 03:02.250
And if you go to the console and type something up and type something.

03:02.540 --> 03:04.920
That's why we are kind of getting it.

03:05.180 --> 03:06.230
We have an error message.

03:06.310 --> 03:09.460
You know it's just showing one for all.

03:09.480 --> 03:15.800
So we are not setting the state correctly and this is because whenever we pass because we are calling

03:15.800 --> 03:22.850
the search team we need to set the state of this ward to the state that we have right here in town.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.190
You know that's why it's not working.

03:25.220 --> 03:27.110
We are not updating the state.

03:27.560 --> 03:28.530
So OK.

03:29.030 --> 03:32.490
Now the thing is that we need to check for some things.

03:32.630 --> 03:39.830
For example if I just go right here to the to the finish one and if I tie something that ties something

03:40.290 --> 03:42.820
you're going to search something with an neph.

03:42.830 --> 03:43.620
We don't have it.

03:43.730 --> 03:45.220
It's not going to return anything.

03:45.410 --> 03:51.420
But if I delete something is going to go back to all the teams is going to show back to all the teams.

03:51.590 --> 03:55.330
So we need a way to check if the keyword is empty or not.

03:55.340 --> 04:02.570
So I'm going to delete this and I'm going to create a conditional right and this one is going to check

04:02.580 --> 04:04.340
if the keyword it's empty.

04:04.340 --> 04:09.820
So you're going to say if keyword it's different than nothing.

04:09.830 --> 04:13.520
Just we want to update the state and filter the teams.

04:13.520 --> 04:19.400
But if it's empty we want to set the state of pretty much everything.

04:19.820 --> 04:21.780
So I'm going to do that with the other one first.

04:21.780 --> 04:31.530
I'm going to say this don't set state and we want to set the state of teams and filter in theory filters.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.260
We already have teams.

04:34.260 --> 04:34.900
All right.

04:34.900 --> 04:41.300
It's the whole database and this one we should not mutate this one but this one we can mutate it as

04:41.300 --> 04:43.020
much as we want.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.070
So I'm going to call the filtered and the filtered.

04:46.130 --> 04:48.800
It's going to be equal to all the teams.

04:49.250 --> 04:57.950
So since we have all the teams inside this that teams inside it is just that state that teams can say

04:58.040 --> 05:04.180
that filter is going to be equals equal to this does that state that teams.

05:04.340 --> 05:04.980
All right.

05:05.240 --> 05:11.030
The next thing is is going to be to set the keyboard whenever we type something we are on the input

05:11.120 --> 05:13.070
we need to update the state of keyboard.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.730
So even though we have nothing we should be doing it right here.

05:16.790 --> 05:22.420
So again it's a keyboard and the keyboard again it's going to be equal to keyboard.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.840
So I'm going to put it right here.

05:26.020 --> 05:30.480
You could say even the target the built that value but in us that we can use keyboard.

05:30.830 --> 05:37.970
So if we have the same key value pairs we can get rid of the second one and say keyboard and that's

05:37.970 --> 05:38.970
going to work.

05:39.500 --> 05:46.430
So now we can check this right now because you know we cannot say for the time something nothing is

05:46.430 --> 05:48.390
going to happen.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.340
So what we need to do.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.390
Birkat Let's go back.

05:54.080 --> 05:59.830
So what do we need to do is to set the first conditional just right now let's just make sure we're going

05:59.840 --> 06:04.250
to put event a target value and see what happens.

06:08.430 --> 06:11.620
If I type something that's when nothing happens.

06:12.050 --> 06:12.810
So OK.

06:13.320 --> 06:20.580
So this is good not what we need to do now is to set the stage in case of we have in case we have something

06:20.880 --> 06:22.090
as volume keyword.

06:22.290 --> 06:26.550
If I type something nothing is going to happen that we have we have a letter right here.

06:26.550 --> 06:33.410
We have character and it's inside the state inside the key sorry the event the event or target the volley.

06:33.420 --> 06:36.150
So now we need to set the state of that.

06:36.490 --> 06:36.870
OK.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.140
That's fine.

06:38.670 --> 06:46.500
Whenever we get a keyword or just a letter we need to search the teams just to run a filter and just

06:46.500 --> 06:52.950
trying to find whatever is inside teams with the keyboards we are typing now for this we cannot use

06:52.950 --> 06:57.320
a map because we don't want to map the entire list.

06:57.330 --> 07:03.210
We just want to find something now to find something we can use a helper that is going to be called

07:03.700 --> 07:04.390
Filter.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.520
You can use that helper.

07:05.730 --> 07:11.820
So I'm going to store everything in evolvable and this helper this filter helpful helper is just like

07:11.820 --> 07:14.880
the map is going to return an array by default.

07:14.880 --> 07:18.140
So I'm going to say Konst list and I'm going to say equal.

07:18.460 --> 07:26.130
And now I want to run a filter so I'm going to say this dot state DOT teams because you want to filter

07:26.400 --> 07:32.820
all the teams and it's going to be dot and we're going to use the Filcher helper or helper.

07:32.850 --> 07:40.700
Just like a map is going to take an item and it's going to run a function OK.

07:41.120 --> 07:47.270
Now whenever we use the filter we need to return something just like a map.

07:47.270 --> 07:54.100
Now what we need to do is we need to return something if it matches a criteria.

07:54.320 --> 08:02.050
So what we need to do is to check if the keyword we are passing it's inside of the name of the team.

08:02.270 --> 08:02.730
Right.

08:02.870 --> 08:07.650
So since we want to check the name of the team we're going to say item dad's name.

08:07.670 --> 08:14.570
Know we have item right here and we access the name since the names in the database are with uppercase

08:14.570 --> 08:16.940
as with capital letters.

08:16.940 --> 08:24.080
We need to convert everything to lowercase before we can compare the keywords we are entering with the

08:24.110 --> 08:26.230
actual name on the database.

08:26.230 --> 08:37.130
So I'm going to say to lower case and just have it right here to lower case this is a javascript function

08:37.400 --> 08:41.050
that's going to grab whatever value you're calling bringing in right here.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.660
It's converting everything to lowercase.

08:43.760 --> 08:48.950
Now to check if the keyword it's inside of the the name of the team.

08:49.010 --> 08:51.870
Well we can use because we can make use of the index off.

08:51.870 --> 08:57.670
So I'm going to say index off and right here we pass what we want to check.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.440
And we want to check the keyword.

08:59.540 --> 09:04.860
So we say Key says this keyword could be in uppercase is whenever we type break here.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.210
Again we want to convert this keyword to lowercase so we can skip our messages.

09:11.210 --> 09:15.420
Now if there is some match right here it's going to return something.

09:15.590 --> 09:22.660
So we're going to check if these if there is a match and if it's greater than minus one.

09:22.730 --> 09:30.830
Now if there is a match this index off it's going to return something that is zero OK and greater than

09:30.840 --> 09:38.540
1 reader I'm sorry greater than zero but since if there is nothing we want to return something that

09:38.540 --> 09:41.480
is less than 1 or I that's fine.

09:41.840 --> 09:45.190
So if it's zero is going to it means that we found a match.

09:45.380 --> 09:53.700
But if it's a negative number just like less than zero which is one we're going to get that.

09:54.050 --> 09:55.450
It's not finding anything.

09:55.460 --> 09:57.260
That's pretty much what's doing.

09:57.560 --> 09:58.490
So that's fine.

09:58.550 --> 10:00.660
You know this is just javascript.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.660
It's not.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.190
Yes.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.920
So it's not react just plain Javascript.

10:05.210 --> 10:09.640
So let's reload the page and see what happens.

10:10.370 --> 10:10.720
OK.

10:10.790 --> 10:16.700
Nothing is going to happen because we are returning everything inside the list Marvel.

10:16.880 --> 10:22.700
Now what we need to do is to update the state with whatever we have inside the list.

10:22.700 --> 10:30.530
So I'm going to go right here I'm going to call the set state right where we such state we want to change

10:30.920 --> 10:32.520
the state of the things.

10:32.600 --> 10:40.900
So first we want to change the state of filter right filter is going to be equal to whatever you're

10:40.940 --> 10:42.500
getting inside list.

10:42.500 --> 10:49.130
So if I say list should be working now since this is going we need to do the same thing we did with

10:49.190 --> 10:54.680
keyboard type keyword and event the target value.

10:54.680 --> 11:00.020
Now if I type something it's going to update the input is going to search if there is a match and if

11:00.020 --> 11:06.900
there is a match is going to return everything inside list and then we said the state of filter list.

11:07.090 --> 11:08.610
Let's see what happens.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.350
It's I pocks and it's working.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.520
Good talks.

11:14.670 --> 11:20.490
If I just delete everything since we set a default as a scenario it's going to show all the teams.

11:20.610 --> 11:30.110
If I type something something else so thick Celltex know Celtics Arrigo is going to show the Celtics.

11:30.110 --> 11:33.180
So yeah it's working nicely.

11:33.200 --> 11:37.590
So now we're going to go to the next section and we're going to do the styling for this.

11:37.610 --> 11:44.510
And again if you want to go to have and get staff there's no problem you can go and copy the SS and

11:44.510 --> 11:47.210
just paste it in your application.

11:47.300 --> 11:47.790
OK.

11:47.900 --> 11:51.490
So this was fine and I'm and I want to check something else.

11:51.770 --> 11:55.430
I want to show you something else right here we are doing keyboard event.

11:55.460 --> 11:57.170
The target value.

11:57.290 --> 12:00.370
The thing is that we already have have it right here.

12:00.530 --> 12:06.830
So if I just delete this key word is going to be equal to keyboard.

12:07.110 --> 12:07.740
Right.

12:07.850 --> 12:09.740
If I did this again.

12:09.740 --> 12:12.840
Again keyboard is going to be equal to the keyboard.

12:12.920 --> 12:18.520
We have right here so if I type Hock's it's going to still work.

12:18.630 --> 12:19.630
If you go to Celtic

12:22.330 --> 12:30.130
it works right with ESX and this is ESX it's not it's not react whenever you have a key value per with

12:30.130 --> 12:31.680
the same name.

12:32.320 --> 12:35.610
Javascript it's gonna assume that you have the same.

12:35.620 --> 12:40.140
So if you put one it will still understand what you want to do.

12:40.510 --> 12:46.160
So if you get confused with this off it's confusing you know if there is a match is going to return

12:46.170 --> 12:50.860
or return a positive number and if it's not it's going to return minus 1.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.880
OK so that's fine.

12:52.960 --> 12:56.300
Let's go to the next section and do the styling for this.
