WEBVTT

00:01.910 --> 00:06.490
OK so let's start adding the stylus and the animation for this.

00:06.490 --> 00:07.040
This is going.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.300
This one is going to be inside blocks of course.

00:09.410 --> 00:12.050
So I'm going to make reference to the home blocks.

00:12.260 --> 00:16.030
We did here the parent container of all the elements.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.920
So I'm going to go right here the bottom and we're going to start doing it.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.530
It's going to say Dot and home blocks.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.950
Now we're going to use flex to show this.

00:23.960 --> 00:29.760
So the first one is going to be a display and flex right.

00:31.090 --> 00:37.090
Just for simplicity I'm not going to add with Web Kit flacs and then Miles flaks just going to do it

00:37.090 --> 00:38.370
for Web Kit.

00:38.450 --> 00:41.990
So OK we have the flex and we can have a direction.

00:42.010 --> 00:45.580
So it's going to be flex direction and we're going to use roll now.

00:45.610 --> 00:52.570
We want everything in a row then we want to select the flex and the wrap and the wrap is going to be

00:52.650 --> 00:53.260
wrapped.

00:53.530 --> 00:54.660
Right.

00:54.670 --> 00:58.840
So we wanted to add a margin top can say margin.

00:58.840 --> 01:02.880
And then just top and the margin is going to be 40 pixels.

01:02.890 --> 01:04.840
No we can just separate.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.230
The it's described to us from the Bloks we have right here.

01:08.590 --> 01:13.000
So now we need to make reference to each item that we have right here.

01:13.060 --> 01:15.140
Each item we have the class right here.

01:15.250 --> 01:19.630
So they want to make reference to that we're going to copy home blocks right here the bottom and say

01:19.630 --> 01:21.940
Dot item right.

01:22.060 --> 01:27.940
So each item is going to have a flex grow of one.

01:27.970 --> 01:32.850
Now the position is going to be relative relative frigate.

01:33.280 --> 01:39.040
Now we're going to have a fixed hide and it's going to be two hundred and seventy pixels and then the

01:39.100 --> 01:40.840
overflow is going to be hidden.

01:40.840 --> 01:46.170
Now whenever we Hoeber and this can have a tax rate here.

01:46.330 --> 01:51.280
So whenever this is want this one it's out of the box it should be should be hidden.

01:51.280 --> 01:54.310
So we want to set the flow hit him for that.

01:54.640 --> 02:00.450
So we have the 200 or so of pixels and we set overflow and then just hand.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.770
Right.

02:01.820 --> 02:06.370
And if you go right here of course you're going to get something.

02:06.400 --> 02:10.560
But now it looks nice and notice that this one is already big.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.660
This one is medium and this one is small.

02:12.700 --> 02:16.970
It's grabbing the classes that we are passing right here an item type.

02:17.110 --> 02:18.460
So that's working.

02:18.490 --> 02:25.730
Now what we need to do is we need to set up some of some just some values for the large medium and small.

02:25.900 --> 02:32.550
So again going to make reference to home blocks and begin to make reference to that item.

02:32.740 --> 02:39.110
And we want to grab the large one the large one right there we go.

02:39.460 --> 02:45.850
So the large one is going to have with and it's going to have with a 50 percent then we can have the

02:45.850 --> 02:48.200
same thing for medium.

02:48.220 --> 02:53.660
So going to go type medium but this one is going to be a little bit smaller.

02:53.920 --> 03:00.020
So we're going to say 30 and then we can have the small it's going to copy and paste that and say it

03:00.090 --> 03:01.130
is Sam.

03:01.240 --> 03:07.840
Now the S M is going to have a 20 you know 50 plus 30 plus 20 100 percent.

03:08.020 --> 03:09.930
So it's going to just wrap everything.

03:10.550 --> 03:11.020
Good.

03:11.080 --> 03:11.620
OK.

03:11.860 --> 03:12.990
So what is next.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.820
We need to set the image for this.

03:15.010 --> 03:20.480
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and make reference again to home that blocks.

03:20.510 --> 03:25.330
Now again make reference to item and now we want to style the image.

03:25.420 --> 03:29.680
And of course we we we have a class for this on each element.

03:29.680 --> 03:33.600
And I believe it's going to be right here image.

03:34.270 --> 03:37.790
So back to the SS and when to add styles.

03:37.810 --> 03:45.370
So each image is going to be it's going to be a height of 270 pixels you know the full height of the

03:45.400 --> 03:47.150
block we have right here.

03:47.740 --> 03:49.690
So we can have a background size for this.

03:49.690 --> 03:54.880
It's going to be the background and it can say background and then to size and the size is going to

03:54.880 --> 03:55.750
be cover.

03:55.930 --> 03:59.370
And then important Breguet.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.120
Now we're going to have a background position.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.800
Everything is going to be centered.

04:02.830 --> 04:10.000
So I'm going to say background and then position and then center center everything is going to be centered.

04:10.810 --> 04:17.070
And then of course a mistake center Burguet And of course this is going to be important.

04:18.760 --> 04:19.390
Right.

04:19.660 --> 04:26.140
I can look at right now let's just add the title the at the styles for the title not just the other

04:27.450 --> 04:28.270
works.

04:28.440 --> 04:29.790
We can have a tiny problem.

04:29.800 --> 04:35.950
Whenever we load the application it's just going to show all at the same time and we don't want that

04:35.980 --> 04:38.340
we want just different behavior.

04:38.340 --> 04:44.050
I can scroll down and you know it's just like this and we're going to do this directly from the CSSA.

04:44.350 --> 04:48.520
So let's first add the styles to the title.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.910
You're going to see it right now.

04:49.950 --> 04:51.850
But now we're going to add it right now.

04:52.180 --> 04:57.970
And just to save some time we're going to say home and blocks we're going to make reference to item

04:58.390 --> 05:02.890
item and we make reference to the title.

05:03.400 --> 05:11.380
So the title is going to have a background of black you know something simple black you can have a panning

05:11.380 --> 05:14.690
of 10 pixels and then begin to have a transition.

05:14.710 --> 05:19.710
Whenever we Hoover the block this title it's going to show.

05:19.830 --> 05:20.160
Right.

05:20.170 --> 05:27.510
So we're going to have a chat session and the recession is going to anime it all is going to take 500

05:27.520 --> 05:33.420
milliseconds and it's going to be it's in out right.

05:33.460 --> 05:40.300
So now let's add the animation for this Hoeber event so we can get a copy of this just for simplicity

05:40.690 --> 05:45.400
and what we want to trigger this new styles this animation.

05:45.400 --> 05:53.880
Whenever we do Hoover on the item Hoover So OK.

05:54.010 --> 05:59.650
So what we want to do we want to animate this from bottom to top.

05:59.680 --> 06:04.410
You know whenever we Hoover it's going to go from bottom to top.

06:04.570 --> 06:11.290
So we want to use to transform going to use transform and then we say translate.

06:11.460 --> 06:12.780
I made a mistake.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.960
Translated.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.920
OK.

06:17.740 --> 06:19.420
There you go translate.

06:19.570 --> 06:29.130
And we want to animate zero pixels and then I'm going to say minus and 39 right and just close it.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.300
Good.

06:30.330 --> 06:35.380
Now again we need to do the transitions all going to just copy and paste it.

06:35.410 --> 06:41.500
So whenever this starts this item of course since it's a block item it's going to be just below the

06:41.500 --> 06:42.070
image.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.400
So it's going to be right here.

06:43.420 --> 06:44.350
It's going to begin.

06:44.560 --> 06:49.780
So we hope for and this one is going to do the animation is going to translate is just going to animate

06:49.840 --> 06:55.240
the element from bottom to top and it's going to stop and then we when we remove it it's going to go

06:55.240 --> 06:57.010
to the original position.

06:57.330 --> 07:04.420
And we have the transitions all on both elements it's going to go and go back just go in and go back.

07:04.420 --> 07:07.840
Let's see if this is happening on our project.

07:07.990 --> 07:12.480
If we're working let's get right now.

07:12.490 --> 07:14.280
This one is too small for this.

07:14.330 --> 07:16.810
You know you're going to have a problem right there.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.440
You know it's good anyways.

07:21.050 --> 07:21.540
OK.

07:21.650 --> 07:22.580
So what else.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.060
This blue link.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.900
I just really I don't like that.

07:27.050 --> 07:35.120
So I'm going to just make reference to that link and change the color of the link and say item dot title

07:35.360 --> 07:36.400
and then a.

07:36.590 --> 07:44.290
Right and the A It's going to have a color and the color it's going to be just a white color but a good

07:45.820 --> 07:48.510
so we are almost there.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.040
What else do we need to do.

07:50.050 --> 07:58.840
So whenever we go to the original and scroll down we have this effect as if for now whenever we just

07:58.840 --> 08:05.770
reload the application and scroll down it's animating all the elements just in blocks but we don't want

08:05.770 --> 08:06.360
that.

08:06.400 --> 08:12.070
Now what we can do we can delay the transition for each element.

08:12.070 --> 08:17.770
If it's large it's going to bring that big at first and if it's a medium it's going to wait a few seconds

08:17.770 --> 08:20.340
just a few milliseconds and then animated.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.220
We can do this from CSSA.

08:22.510 --> 08:24.160
So I'm going to go right here.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.600
I'm going to just make reference to the home blocks.

08:27.760 --> 08:32.180
I'm going to select the item we want to animate and the first one is going to be the large.

08:32.590 --> 08:33.120
OK.

08:33.490 --> 08:37.740
So there is a property on CSX that it's going to be animation delay.

08:37.870 --> 08:41.860
So pretty much we add a delay to each animation.

08:42.130 --> 08:45.340
So since I'm using Chrome I'm just going to use Web Kit.

08:45.520 --> 08:46.170
OK.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.220
Can I have it right here.

08:47.230 --> 08:48.950
Just let me copy paste it.

08:49.150 --> 08:52.120
Me use weskit animation delay.

08:52.260 --> 08:55.080
This is going to delay the animation principle.

08:55.140 --> 09:02.060
If you're using different vendors like Mozilla Firefox we have to use Dorsch mouse dash animation.

09:02.250 --> 09:08.030
And for Microsoft from Internet Explorer we do Dorsch M-S just to save time.

09:08.040 --> 09:11.210
I'm just going to do Web Kit because I'm using Chrome right.

09:11.250 --> 09:16.290
So we're going to add a delay to the animation and it should be working right now.

09:16.290 --> 09:19.480
If I scroll down you know it's working.

09:19.770 --> 09:25.490
So I'm going to just do the same thing for the other ones and just increase the animation delay.

09:25.890 --> 09:26.260
OK.

09:26.280 --> 09:32.580
This one is going to be 500 and instead of large it's going to be empty.

09:32.940 --> 09:37.710
I'm just going to copy this one and make reference to the small one.

09:37.750 --> 09:41.650
It's going to be awesome and I'm just going to type 800.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.940
Now you can type whatever you want right here.

09:44.220 --> 09:47.020
If I read the application go down.

09:47.310 --> 09:47.730
OK.

09:47.790 --> 09:48.810
So it's working.

09:48.810 --> 09:49.590
That's good.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.570
All right.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.020
So now what is next.

09:52.020 --> 09:57.270
The only thing left is to add this veil effect this over in black.

09:57.270 --> 10:02.300
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I've going to make reference to this veil we created

10:02.310 --> 10:09.430
before I was going to say home locks and then item and then dot veil.

10:09.750 --> 10:14.580
So this veil is going to be floating on top of the whole element.

10:14.610 --> 10:16.710
So it's going to be a position absolute.

10:16.940 --> 10:21.550
So right again this first set of background and the background is going to be black.

10:21.570 --> 10:28.130
So as hash tag and six zeroes right begin to set an opacity for this.

10:28.230 --> 10:34.390
And the capacity I've chosen 0.7 now the hide is going to be absolute.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.020
We can use percent's.

10:36.150 --> 10:38.160
So I'm going to set it to 100 percent.

10:38.460 --> 10:40.680
And the with is going to be 100.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.530
No make sense.

10:42.690 --> 10:44.970
We're going to cover the whole elements.

10:45.100 --> 10:53.310
You want to send it to top when to everything to be on top and then we sent the position position and

10:53.310 --> 10:59.820
then it's going to be absolute right since we want to animate whenever we Hoover we need to use the

10:59.820 --> 11:00.560
transition.

11:00.660 --> 11:05.260
And I'm going to just animate all transitions.

11:05.390 --> 11:06.340
Right.

11:06.400 --> 11:13.180
So now we need to go you know it's good but we need to add animation to this to the Hoover event.

11:13.240 --> 11:18.120
So get a copy of this go right here at the bottom and open and close.

11:18.120 --> 11:23.490
It says We want to trigger whoever is going to select the item and say Hoover.

11:23.950 --> 11:27.120
And the only thing we need to do right here is change the opacity.

11:27.310 --> 11:30.070
The person he is now is going to be 0.7.

11:30.130 --> 11:30.990
Going to be zero.

11:31.030 --> 11:36.960
So I'm going to go ahead and delete the seven since we want to trigger a transition.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.520
I'm going to just do transition.

11:38.540 --> 11:46.930
All you can do on the transition opacity right here instead of all good now should be working good to

11:47.020 --> 11:48.370
go right here.

11:48.810 --> 11:49.170
OK.

11:49.180 --> 11:49.880
It's working.

11:49.890 --> 11:58.200
If I do however get to everything looks nice when we make it bigger we go.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.050
I'm using Windows 10 of course.

12:01.450 --> 12:02.200
There you go.

12:02.410 --> 12:03.490
So that's better.

12:04.980 --> 12:06.900
Me just do it again.

12:10.270 --> 12:10.640
OK.

12:10.670 --> 12:12.710
So this is working.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.180
We're going to go to the next component.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.870
It's going to be the pole components right here.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.300
We have just a poll who will be the champion.

12:20.300 --> 12:24.600
And whenever we click this is going to just add a boat to it.

12:24.800 --> 12:30.310
And of course this boats are going to be saved into the Jason database of course.

12:30.470 --> 12:33.980
And you know again I'm going to change some values right now.

12:34.010 --> 12:38.450
Whenever we click this is going to re render and do some things inside here.

12:38.570 --> 12:42.420
Let's go to the next section and begin to talk about this component.
