00:01.580 --> 00:05.380
OK so let's start building the header and footer right here from the Abdulle.

00:05.420 --> 00:09.160
Yes we've included this from header and footer.

00:09.340 --> 00:12.610
So let's go to the head on that as we're going to do that one first.

00:12.650 --> 00:15.510
Going to delete the header text and go to this.

00:15.510 --> 00:17.820
Def can you use this as a container.

00:17.850 --> 00:24.650
So first I'm going to use a class name and we can do pretty much everything we can to use fluxbox.

00:24.730 --> 00:27.710
We can have linking the left and just teams in the right.

00:27.730 --> 00:32.770
But basically these are just two links so we going to make use of link re-act router.

00:33.080 --> 00:37.690
But this one is going to be a flex box the dash container.

00:37.730 --> 00:40.610
Right now we need to set up the logo.

00:40.640 --> 00:47.160
So since it's going to be link I'm going to say link now we're going to use a span to host that image.

00:47.570 --> 00:50.170
And this link is going to link to.

00:50.450 --> 00:51.520
And it's going to go home.

00:51.560 --> 00:53.190
So I'm going to say for Slash.

00:53.420 --> 00:58.920
I'm just going to add a class name to this and just look up.

00:59.060 --> 01:04.070
OK so in the right side we have the teams and this is kind of a Nav. element.

01:04.130 --> 01:05.510
So I'm going to say now.

01:06.010 --> 01:06.740
Right.

01:06.860 --> 01:10.330
We're going to make use of link again just opening close.

01:10.850 --> 01:12.860
And this is going to go to teams.

01:12.980 --> 01:13.750
Right.

01:13.820 --> 01:18.910
So I'm going to say two equal and then four slash teams.

01:19.670 --> 01:20.110
Right.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.490
So good fun.

01:22.580 --> 01:22.990
OK.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.440
Let's go to the footer.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.750
Now if you notice we've accomplished this footer component directly from the header.

01:29.900 --> 01:32.110
So right now we have the header right here.

01:32.300 --> 01:36.610
But we need to say footer so we can change it to footer.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.560
So the footer it's really really simple.

01:39.710 --> 01:40.610
Go right here.

01:40.670 --> 01:44.480
It just have a black bar and then the logo again.

01:44.510 --> 01:52.430
So just like with that before I'm going to go right here and put a class name call and then flex box

01:52.700 --> 01:54.270
then Dasch container.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.090
Great use the same class.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.990
And now we need to add a class name for the logo.

01:59.030 --> 02:02.920
So I'm going to say Dev and it's now I'm looking to make a link just an image.

02:03.140 --> 02:07.640
So we're going to use class name and then it's going to be logo just like the header.

02:07.790 --> 02:11.050
And inside we will add a span.

02:11.270 --> 02:12.420
All right.

02:12.770 --> 02:13.400
That looks nice.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.250
Looks good.

02:14.940 --> 02:21.000
So right now of course we don't have anything to change this from styles so let's go to the next section

02:21.090 --> 02:24.570
and do and start adding the styles for this.

02:24.570 --> 02:31.710
Now remember that you can go if you want to just skip the styles section because it's kind of boring.

02:31.710 --> 02:33.890
It's not about re-act is just smiling.

02:34.050 --> 02:38.470
It just can go to the good have project and just copy the styles.

02:38.490 --> 02:39.230
OK.

02:39.240 --> 02:45.050
The only thing that you need to know is that because you use two different fonts we can to use pygmies

02:45.060 --> 02:46.080
row boto font.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.620
I have it ready right here.

02:47.850 --> 02:50.600
Let me just open this.

02:50.650 --> 02:55.790
I was going to use Roboto and begin to use hello or something like that one.

02:55.820 --> 03:02.460
We're going to use this this funds and we can just be using the CSSA directly from public begin to create

03:02.460 --> 03:07.680
a folder that's going to be CSSA and begin and create a file that is going to be style that CSSA just

03:07.680 --> 03:08.850
like we did before.

03:09.090 --> 03:13.560
OK let's go to the next section and start doing start with styles.

03:13.560 --> 03:13.980
For this.
