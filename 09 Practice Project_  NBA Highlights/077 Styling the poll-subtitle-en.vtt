WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:04.520
OK so let's add some style to the whole.

00:04.590 --> 00:07.300
So everything is going to be kind enough to center right here.

00:07.500 --> 00:10.550
So I'm going to go and start with this it's going to be real fast.

00:10.680 --> 00:13.320
So we're going to call the home poll.

00:13.450 --> 00:18.530
They gave it that class yeah home poll Burguet.

00:18.570 --> 00:25.980
So this whole poll is going to have up with oh you're going can have it with and the with is going to

00:25.980 --> 00:30.600
be just somebody 70 percent you know you can use whatever you want.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.450
It's going to be center so I can to say Margene 0.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.380
I would go get the text line.

00:36.380 --> 00:40.060
I think it's going to be centered.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.110
There you go.

00:41.610 --> 00:43.990
So now the poll container.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.050
Go right here.

00:45.210 --> 00:47.310
We have a poll container.

00:47.310 --> 00:48.410
This one right here.

00:48.570 --> 00:51.460
So we are going to we want to use flex for this.

00:51.460 --> 00:53.050
So I'm going to use a home poll.

00:53.050 --> 01:01.770
Now I'm just going to call the Paul container poll and then just container right the container you can

01:01.770 --> 01:03.670
have you can have flex to this.

01:03.720 --> 01:09.930
So I'm just going to copy something I have right here and just make it flex you know I'm for Microsoft

01:10.380 --> 01:15.140
and with Kate for the good browsers and then just flex for all that.

01:15.330 --> 01:23.390
So I'm going to access this pole container up access the pole container and just trigger.

01:23.480 --> 01:26.910
Just point this each item on the pole.

01:26.930 --> 01:30.550
I'm going to say pull and it's going to be item.

01:31.400 --> 01:31.970
OK.

01:32.240 --> 01:36.470
So we can have padding of of pixels you know.

01:36.890 --> 01:42.790
And we can have flex grow of one.

01:43.130 --> 01:48.610
So it's going to be kind of a floated.

01:48.900 --> 01:53.730
Of course you're not seeing it because we're not setting the size correctly but Daury we're going to

01:53.730 --> 01:54.860
do it in a minute.

01:54.930 --> 02:00.990
So it's going to be putting 20 flex row of one go wrench or the bottom can we call the pole container

02:02.060 --> 02:05.970
and get it just make the image a little bit smaller.

02:05.990 --> 02:08.650
You can say you going to set it with that image.

02:08.730 --> 02:12.130
So it's going to occupy the 80 percent of the container.

02:12.180 --> 02:18.550
So you know we get this get you know we're going to style this other bit.

02:18.810 --> 02:24.930
So I'm going to go right here the bottom select pull container and pull item and we're going to just

02:25.740 --> 02:29.260
select the dips inside and we're going to change the fonts.

02:29.310 --> 02:33.260
So I'm going to select the font family if I have one.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.020
Yeah.

02:35.460 --> 02:42.220
Just to change that and we're going to get it the font size of 18 pixels.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.010
It is good right.

02:45.080 --> 02:49.220
Nice looks nice you know if you look at it's going to add.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.380
And if you click it again it's going to app.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.770
This is kind of a joke.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.090
I am a big fan.

02:54.100 --> 02:57.730
I'm not a big fan just a fan of the Knicks the New York Knicks.

02:57.850 --> 03:07.020
I've always live in your next and you know since the Patrick Wing season I know times whenever and I

03:07.680 --> 03:11.120
really like them but they never win.

03:11.160 --> 03:16.950
That's why I've used the 11 boats and that just the other you know it's just a joke.

03:17.870 --> 03:18.210
OK.

03:18.260 --> 03:22.000
So if you're a Knicks fan don't get upset.

03:22.020 --> 03:24.060
But this just a just a job.

03:24.230 --> 03:24.640
So OK.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.340
Let's go to the next section and we will start creating the teams.

03:28.550 --> 03:34.900
So whenever we go to teams link we go to a new location and we can have a list of all the teams since

03:34.940 --> 03:36.270
we have it on the database.

03:36.290 --> 03:41.750
We just bring the images but the good thing about this is that whenever we just load the page we have

03:41.750 --> 03:48.140
a transition and if we search for a team or no Pacer's we get that transition and it's filtering the

03:48.140 --> 03:49.760
teams right.

03:49.790 --> 03:51.420
So let's go to the next section.

03:51.470 --> 03:54.760
I'm going to drink coffee first because I'm kind of tired right now.

03:54.890 --> 03:56.530
And then begin it start doing this.
