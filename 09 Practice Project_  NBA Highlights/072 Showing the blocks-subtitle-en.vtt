00:02.460 --> 00:05.660
OK so let's finish the react part of this.

00:05.760 --> 00:09.610
I want to go back to the project and we are just rendering something so that is good.

00:09.780 --> 00:12.010
And it's this reveal it's working.

00:12.030 --> 00:18.050
So what we need to do right now if I go to the Jason database we're going to loop this box.

00:18.130 --> 00:21.690
And first it's going to go to the first iteration and it's going to put it right here.

00:21.960 --> 00:27.840
Now the thing is that we need to set some classes to specify which yes that this one is going to be

00:27.840 --> 00:28.370
big.

00:28.380 --> 00:31.640
This one is going to be small medium and then small.

00:31.830 --> 00:35.340
So which each with each block we can have a type.

00:35.340 --> 00:39.110
So this one is going to be large medium and small.

00:39.180 --> 00:44.160
So what we can do we can just bring that from item and put it right here.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.670
The class that we want.

00:45.720 --> 00:50.140
So since we want a class name I'm going to say class name right.

00:50.160 --> 00:54.900
And this one is going to be equal to something that we are going to pass when we act.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.070
I would be to do it.

00:56.130 --> 00:58.630
We want to pass some template strings.

00:58.830 --> 01:04.380
So this is going to have by default a class that is going to be called item.

01:04.380 --> 01:04.860
Right.

01:05.100 --> 01:10.850
So then what we do is we need to pass the type that it's going to be inside that Jason.

01:11.250 --> 01:13.390
OK so I'm going to use curl.

01:13.500 --> 01:17.280
Don't sign the curly braces and break here.

01:17.280 --> 01:24.260
I'm going to make reference to item dot type right.

01:24.340 --> 01:28.570
So let's go back and of course nothing is going to happen because we don't have the classes for this

01:28.570 --> 01:28.860
yet.

01:28.900 --> 01:34.270
We need to set up on the S S Now whenever the the the s component loads.

01:34.330 --> 01:40.180
Each component which each item we can have something that I call bail.

01:40.180 --> 01:44.350
You know this black whenever we over we can just get rid of that bailout.

01:44.470 --> 01:46.510
But first we will need the elements.

01:46.720 --> 01:54.100
So I'm going to say Dev and inside here are going to add a class name of bail that we're going to give

01:54.100 --> 01:55.800
dishtowels to this.

01:55.810 --> 02:01.060
Now inside of each element you can have an image OK.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.540
And then we can have the title.

02:02.650 --> 02:03.090
OK.

02:03.250 --> 02:04.570
So I'm going to go right here.

02:04.840 --> 02:11.050
I'm going to say DIVX and just additive right here and it just add some some styles.

02:11.050 --> 02:17.260
First one we need to put the class and the class is going to be image you know something generic.

02:17.260 --> 02:21.960
Then we can have a style and we can pass whatever you are l.

02:22.090 --> 02:23.290
We want to put right here.

02:23.290 --> 02:25.770
The image you're going to pass a background for this.

02:26.050 --> 02:30.150
So the background again is going to be on the C Ss right here image.

02:30.460 --> 02:32.050
So we just need to make reference.

02:32.170 --> 02:39.640
If you remember whenever we pass inline styles we need to do two curly braces so I'm going to say background

02:40.690 --> 02:42.960
and the background is going to be equal to.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.300
And we're going to use template strings.

02:45.340 --> 02:53.590
The background is going to be inside your L open close and it's going to be four slash images for Slash

02:53.740 --> 03:02.080
blocks for Slash and then the name of the image says we want to get it from the from the map it's going

03:02.080 --> 03:05.070
to be item dot image.

03:05.440 --> 03:10.790
And this is going to have no repeat y.

03:10.850 --> 03:12.490
So looks looks nice.

03:12.980 --> 03:15.440
OK so what else what else do we to do.

03:15.440 --> 03:21.770
I'm going to write this down whenever we just Hoeber we have kind of a block but it's showing a title

03:21.920 --> 03:22.740
with the link.

03:22.990 --> 03:27.870
So OK I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to add an element for this.

03:27.910 --> 03:30.450
This one I gave it a class of title.

03:30.650 --> 03:39.670
So I'm going to say title right then since you want to pass a link and we are using link right here.

03:39.860 --> 03:42.640
I going to say link right.

03:42.770 --> 03:47.380
The title of this is going to be inside of the Jasen inside of each element.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.210
And we need to call the title.

03:49.400 --> 03:56.030
So I'm going to just open and close and I get to say item that title right.

03:56.090 --> 04:02.780
And this one is going to link to a place and place we have right here we have the location right here

04:02.810 --> 04:04.120
inside link.

04:04.130 --> 04:08.530
So again I'm going to delete this and just call it.

04:08.650 --> 04:12.520
It's going to be item dot like.

04:12.580 --> 04:13.370
All right.

04:13.390 --> 04:17.340
Right here this one is the how it should look like.

04:17.500 --> 04:24.620
And if I go to the Riehle project it nothing's going to happen because we need to do a lot of styling

04:24.800 --> 04:29.040
to Animorphs styles and to do the animations for this.

04:29.050 --> 04:30.470
So let's go to the next section.

04:30.550 --> 04:36.190
And you know if you are comfortable you know how to do CSSA and sessions and everything else you just

04:36.190 --> 04:41.120
can copy the code from get half and move forward to the next re-act components.

04:41.560 --> 04:46.890
If you want to know how how big how I did this right from the start.

04:46.900 --> 04:52.770
Just go to the next section and we will do much all the assassination and transitions for this.

04:52.870 --> 04:53.820
Let's go to the next section.
