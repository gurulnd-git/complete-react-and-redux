00:00.800 --> 00:06.200
OK so now we're going to talk about one of the most important features of react.

00:06.230 --> 00:10.660
We're just going to be state this is not that easy to understand.

00:10.670 --> 00:13.540
So if you don't get it completely Don't worry.

00:13.580 --> 00:17.750
It's one of those things we are going to be using quite a lot.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.670
So you will have a lot of practice.

00:19.700 --> 00:20.540
Don't worry.

00:20.900 --> 00:29.270
So the state it's kind of an object that serves us just like a database so we can store values check

00:29.270 --> 00:30.240
for events.

00:30.260 --> 00:36.190
So pretty much through the state we can control how the component behaves.

00:36.560 --> 00:41.320
So remember we talked about functional components and class based components.

00:41.600 --> 00:47.790
Well every time we create a class for react we get a default state.

00:47.930 --> 00:49.070
It's going to be empty.

00:49.100 --> 00:55.760
Start of course and with the functional components since they are not classes we don't get an estate

00:56.090 --> 01:00.250
and they are going to be stateless and you're going to use that you're going to hurt here.

01:00.480 --> 01:02.940
The term alaap stateless.

01:03.410 --> 01:06.650
But the class component it's not stateless.

01:07.010 --> 01:13.310
So with the class component if the state changes for whatever reason the application is going to read

01:13.310 --> 01:16.560
render the component let's say that we have a state right here.

01:16.580 --> 01:21.920
We can create it create a state in a few seconds and something happens right here with the input for

01:21.920 --> 01:25.920
example and we change the state reacting.

01:26.090 --> 01:29.280
It's listening for these state change.

01:29.300 --> 01:34.240
And whenever there is a change and the state is going to grab this render method and he's going to re

01:34.270 --> 01:36.540
render whatever we have right here.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.370
OK that is good.

01:38.660 --> 01:47.240
So I'm if you don't know about constructor and super inside ESX you should be you should go back one

01:47.240 --> 01:48.200
lecture.

01:48.310 --> 01:54.500
So OK I'm going to start building this and then we're going to talk about what's happening first when

01:54.500 --> 01:58.250
we create a component we need to call the constructor.

01:58.250 --> 02:05.630
So I'm going to say constructor right here and I'm going to call the constructor since we want to bring

02:05.660 --> 02:10.040
all the settings from react and the components we need to call the super.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.150
And what we want to get.

02:12.200 --> 02:18.460
It's going to be the props that every all the configuration from re-act some going to say prompts.

02:18.470 --> 02:22.520
And again you're going to hear about prop's a lot.

02:22.610 --> 02:30.260
So I started this class called the constructor and passed the the main argument which is going to be

02:30.260 --> 02:36.660
the Propst get now to create a state inside re-act inside the constructor.

02:36.680 --> 02:43.940
What we need to do is we need to call the this keyword and whenever we call this we use dot and then

02:44.030 --> 02:45.480
state.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.060
Now the state is going to be just an object.

02:48.220 --> 02:50.300
OK so we do equal.

02:50.510 --> 02:52.590
And then just curly braces.

02:52.700 --> 02:58.200
Now since this is just an object we can just write all the information we want right here.

02:58.250 --> 03:01.820
All the data we want just like a regular object.

03:01.820 --> 03:09.470
So what I'm going to do I'm going to say keyboards and keyboards is going to be whatever the user types

03:09.530 --> 03:10.160
right here.

03:10.310 --> 03:16.250
So if the user types something begin to change the state and begin to put the values right here.

03:16.250 --> 03:24.250
So if I type John right here re-act is going to ground the values and store the name John.

03:24.260 --> 03:31.140
Inside the state and since the state is going to be changing it's going to re render every time it changes.

03:31.220 --> 03:32.330
So that's good.

03:32.330 --> 03:38.270
So the way to create a state it's just like this inside the constructor.

03:38.270 --> 03:43.130
After the Super be called this dot state and so we have a stake.

03:43.280 --> 03:47.690
Now if I just delete super and reload the application begin to get an error.

03:47.720 --> 03:50.540
It says this is not allowed before Super.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.920
So we need to use this super.

03:53.210 --> 03:53.960
All right.

03:54.320 --> 03:54.830
OK.

03:54.980 --> 03:56.010
That is fine.

03:56.020 --> 03:58.170
This is enough for the first part.

03:58.340 --> 03:59.800
Let's go to the next section.

03:59.870 --> 04:02.480
And of course we're going to talk a lot a lot about.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.730
We're going to talk more about state.
