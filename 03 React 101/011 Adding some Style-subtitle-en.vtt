WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:03.330
OK so we are going to add some styles to this.

00:03.330 --> 00:05.040
This is really ugly.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.150
So we are going to be working with styles.

00:07.320 --> 00:13.890
Now there are a few libraries available in the re-act world that you can give to your components to

00:13.890 --> 00:15.630
style the components.

00:15.630 --> 00:19.260
So we will just stick to the classics ways to the classic way.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.110
I'm going to show you two methods.

00:21.120 --> 00:25.770
We have the Line method and the import method the inline method.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.510
It's really pretty simple.

00:27.510 --> 00:33.390
We can use an object to fit the styles the inline styles to our elements.

00:33.390 --> 00:38.160
So I'm going to go right here inside the render and I just cannot create a variable.

00:38.190 --> 00:44.870
It's going to be let us use Konst concert and it's going to be styles to something really simple then

00:44.870 --> 00:45.800
it's going to be equal.

00:45.840 --> 00:52.160
And this is going to be equal to an object but so we need to style the yet Hetter for now.

00:52.410 --> 00:59.220
So I you need to make reference to the header is going to be better than calling and then inside here

00:59.290 --> 01:06.150
I will just enter new objects and new values since I want to change the background color the same background

01:08.450 --> 01:12.360
and the background is going to be the hash tag.

01:12.600 --> 01:18.160
0 3 a 9 for something like that.

01:18.490 --> 01:19.070
OK.

01:19.560 --> 01:27.870
So if I wanted to add it more styles to this not just the header style going into coma and then enter

01:27.990 --> 01:30.110
a new key and inside the logo.

01:30.180 --> 01:35.820
I couldn't just get to do pretty much the same thing when I want to do I want to add a color to the

01:35.820 --> 01:36.280
logo.

01:36.300 --> 01:41.660
So it's going to be color and then inside here it's going to be white that coma.

01:41.720 --> 01:47.580
And if I want to add new styles Let's see let's say I want to change the font family for the logo.

01:47.580 --> 01:52.720
So in says what we do it's font dash and then family.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.640
But this is not VSS.

01:54.660 --> 01:57.550
This is javascript so we can use this way.

01:57.810 --> 02:01.220
We need to do it in camel case just like this.

02:01.320 --> 02:04.950
If I say phone family I want to use the Anton.

02:06.240 --> 02:09.600
And if you're asked you're asking yourself what the facts are.

02:09.870 --> 02:17.480
I've added just to Ivory's the phone finally Loraine's the Anton and the Rebozo.

02:17.690 --> 02:22.650
Now you can go to the the Google fonts and get them but they are not really important.

02:22.730 --> 02:23.050
No.

02:23.050 --> 02:24.160
Can Get this.

02:24.540 --> 02:31.160
So after this I want to make a trip to add a text line to make it aligned to the center.

02:31.170 --> 02:36.460
So I'm going to say text a line and then just Center it.

02:36.510 --> 02:41.930
Now I have the devival styles and right here it says styles.

02:41.980 --> 02:45.180
It's a sign but never used again.

02:45.210 --> 02:52.150
Reactor's just giving us a warning saying that you need to use all the variables that you declare.

02:52.320 --> 02:59.110
So right here what I want to do inside the header I want to pass the styles the inline styles of Hetter.

02:59.250 --> 03:06.650
So since this is an object we can access real easy to say style just like standard h g mail.

03:06.780 --> 03:13.560
And since we need to pass an object I'm going to use the curly braces going to say styles which is the

03:14.160 --> 03:16.600
main object right here.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.340
And I want to access the header.

03:18.360 --> 03:25.330
So I going to say Dot Hetter And if you load the page up we are not getting the color.

03:25.350 --> 03:27.370
Let me see why.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.430
When they just reload the page.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.400
And this is why background.

03:36.980 --> 03:38.700
All right so get we get the background.

03:38.710 --> 03:39.630
Let's get.

03:39.680 --> 03:47.450
So if I wanted to add right here a reference to the logo styles we just repeat the same process style

03:47.570 --> 03:52.030
equal to styles down logo.

03:52.710 --> 03:53.100
OK.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.400
And we got the styles for the logo.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.380
Let's get now you know this is good.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.930
This works.

04:00.110 --> 04:05.210
Maybe you can have a lot of styles and this could get really really messy.

04:05.210 --> 04:10.870
So you know if you want to work with less or sace Yeah you're not going to be able to do this.

04:10.910 --> 04:12.480
You just need to do something else.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.120
You need to use an outside library.

04:15.410 --> 04:15.950
So that's why.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.430
So I'm going to just delete this for now.

04:19.430 --> 04:20.550
Just going to delete it.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.190
And notice though one more thing.

04:22.190 --> 04:27.170
Notice that everything right here the styles are inside the render method.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.940
If I put them outside

04:31.910 --> 04:36.070
the page it's not it'll work because this is not accessible from here.

04:36.170 --> 04:38.930
So we need to put them inside the render.

04:39.390 --> 04:39.670
OK.

04:39.740 --> 04:48.490
That's one thing I'm just going to delete it and just go back one second and is do does get now what

04:48.490 --> 04:49.200
are we going to do.

04:49.210 --> 04:51.210
We're going to use the regular method.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.820
You can use the styles just to see an import.

04:54.820 --> 05:00.010
So I'm going to say link and I'm going to be inside the index the main index h d m l and again just

05:00.100 --> 05:10.430
a half equals and then just I don't know C Ss and then style Dunciad says this is going to be rel style

05:10.540 --> 05:11.150
sheets.

05:11.160 --> 05:18.340
I'm going to just copy because I'm lazy and then close it and go to the project right here inside the

05:18.340 --> 05:18.920
pub..

05:18.970 --> 05:20.410
Nick create a new folder.

05:20.410 --> 05:22.230
It's going to be a success.

05:22.570 --> 05:30.110
And right here you file and it's going to be style that CSSA right.

05:30.140 --> 05:31.670
So we can use it this way.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.040
It's right here in the index.

05:33.060 --> 05:37.730
So it's going to load the styles and then it's going to pass the styles to the application just like

05:39.030 --> 05:41.090
we always do.

05:41.330 --> 05:46.790
So what I want to do I want to start with the body I'm going to use a Margene zero so we can get rid

05:46.790 --> 05:54.920
of that panning OK I'm going to say farm family and the farm family for this is going to be Rebozo.

05:55.100 --> 05:55.770
All right.

05:56.020 --> 05:56.350
OK.

05:56.390 --> 05:56.790
That's good.

05:56.790 --> 05:57.780
That's working.

05:57.800 --> 06:01.620
We're going to make reference to the header and I get to say background.

06:01.690 --> 06:02.100
OK.

06:02.120 --> 06:06.710
I know that this is nothing nothing new for you but don't worry I'm going somewhere.

06:06.710 --> 06:12.150
It's going to be 0 3 a 9 f EF 4.

06:12.540 --> 06:20.900
And just again the text line is going to be center now and this is going to be something you want to

06:20.900 --> 06:22.340
make reference to the logo.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.980
I went to style the logo.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.090
So I going to go right here.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.820
Say dot logo.

06:26.850 --> 06:29.510
I'm going to make reference to a class.

06:30.020 --> 06:30.250
OK.

06:30.260 --> 06:33.550
I'm going to say that the color is going to be white.

06:33.740 --> 06:41.970
The font size right here font size is going to be 40 pixels and the font family is going to be on time.

06:42.060 --> 06:42.460
Let's go.

06:42.530 --> 06:44.410
That's going to work.

06:44.450 --> 06:46.820
Now the thing is five below the page nothing happens.

06:46.820 --> 06:49.660
Of course we need to make a reference to this element.

06:49.760 --> 06:58.430
So if I go to Hetter and I go right here and assign a class to it it calls and and it says logo I reload

06:58.430 --> 07:06.200
the page and it's going to fail since say known dorm property class at it given it's giving you right

07:06.200 --> 07:07.070
here a tip.

07:07.070 --> 07:08.640
Did you mean class name.

07:08.900 --> 07:18.280
Well the thing is that we cannot use class whenever this is actually nuch h h h t m l m l is GSX as

07:18.290 --> 07:19.150
Javascript.

07:19.220 --> 07:25.920
So we can it use class because class is served keyboard right here where we are using class.

07:26.060 --> 07:27.750
So we cannot use it this way.

07:27.770 --> 07:32.680
We need to do something else N-G in GSX instead of using class.

07:32.710 --> 07:35.820
What are we going to do we use class name.

07:35.970 --> 07:37.730
And I know this is.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.000
And now it's working.

07:39.200 --> 07:48.140
So I know this is kind of weird because you you you're used to write just class and pass the class but

07:48.200 --> 07:51.470
not anymore with GSX you need to use class name.

07:51.590 --> 07:57.840
But don't worry it's going to hurt at the beginning that you're going to get used to it don't worry.

07:57.860 --> 08:04.910
So again inside GSX no more class now it's class name to use class name right.

08:04.920 --> 08:05.320
That's it.

08:05.330 --> 08:06.930
So this is up to you.

08:06.950 --> 08:10.290
You can use the inline method or the import method.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.140
All right.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.850
OK let's go to the next section.
