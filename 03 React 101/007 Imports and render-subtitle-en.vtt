WEBVTT

00:00.290 --> 00:07.860
OK in order for re-act compile our component and show it on the browser we need to do something else.

00:07.860 --> 00:11.480
We need to let the script know that we want to use.

00:11.550 --> 00:11.920
Right.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.180
And that's why we get this error message.

00:14.370 --> 00:16.840
So I'm going to go right here at the top.

00:16.840 --> 00:22.210
And now what we need to do we need to import react to the equation.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.100
So when I'm going to do.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.790
I'm going to say import and we can use import a lot.

00:26.790 --> 00:32.850
First are going to say react and we are pretty much saying that I want to import something that calls

00:32.850 --> 00:33.990
react.

00:34.080 --> 00:43.250
And the second thing when you specify it from is going to say from Am I going to say re-act react and

00:43.250 --> 00:48.150
this what it's going to do it's going to go to the node modules we have right here.

00:48.320 --> 00:53.460
He's going to look for a folder that calls react and bring this function so we can use it.

00:53.480 --> 00:57.840
Inside this file that's pretty much what's happening in a nutshell so.

00:57.860 --> 00:58.170
OK.

00:58.230 --> 01:01.120
We were going to get a different message app.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.520
It's signed but never used.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.580
That's good.

01:03.590 --> 01:10.310
Now in order to render this component inside to do show this component inside the screen we need to

01:10.340 --> 01:12.750
import and use something else.

01:12.770 --> 01:20.660
The first thing I'm going to do is to import and going to say re-act dumb and I can save from and then

01:20.690 --> 01:25.930
react Zong symbols that up.

01:26.470 --> 01:30.410
It's everything in lower in upper case re-act dong.

01:30.550 --> 01:31.510
That's good.

01:31.520 --> 01:34.670
So we have the component and we have the dependencies.

01:34.730 --> 01:40.100
Now we to show it on the screen and we can use this re-act done to show things on the screen.

01:40.280 --> 01:44.380
So I'm going to call this re-act arm.

01:45.650 --> 01:49.790
And now when we need to use a method that's called that calls render.

01:49.820 --> 01:55.230
So I'm going to say Dot and say render and then just open and close.

01:55.400 --> 01:55.770
Right.

01:55.790 --> 02:02.260
So we want to use this renderer to show something on the screen but we get an error message right here.

02:02.270 --> 02:07.550
This render method is going to it's going to need two different arguments.

02:07.610 --> 02:10.970
The first one is what we want to render.

02:11.060 --> 02:14.820
We want to render the component we need to pass the components.

02:14.920 --> 02:15.840
OK that's good.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.960
So let me just do that.

02:18.070 --> 02:25.250
I'm not going to say OK we want to pass to render something that calls app going to say app.

02:25.410 --> 02:27.560
Ok so we get a new message.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.290
And that is good.

02:28.290 --> 02:33.150
Whenever you get different error messages it means that you're kind of advancing.

02:33.210 --> 02:39.990
So we get invalid component element instead of passing a class like food pass our react create element.

02:40.070 --> 02:41.250
OK that's good.

02:41.250 --> 02:51.650
So whenever we do this we are just telling the react on Brender that we want to output a component class

02:52.290 --> 02:58.190
and what we have here it's a component element or instance we don't have a component class.

02:58.440 --> 03:06.630
So in order to convert this to the let's add the react route Don no we want to show this what we need

03:06.630 --> 03:13.900
to do is kind of a we need to convert like a like kind of a using an HDMI tag just like this.

03:14.190 --> 03:19.380
And this is what again it's going to do is going to grab whatever you have inside here and not the actual

03:19.590 --> 03:19.970
class.

03:19.980 --> 03:24.290
It's like putting up a name of a function.

03:24.450 --> 03:28.860
And of course whenever you pass the name of that function you're passing the function and that what

03:28.920 --> 03:30.330
it's inside the function.

03:30.330 --> 03:34.830
So this is the same thing we want to render whatever it's inside app.

03:34.830 --> 03:35.750
All right that's good.

03:35.790 --> 03:40.580
If I saved this is going to reload the page and we get target container.

03:40.590 --> 03:42.680
It's not a DOM elements.

03:42.910 --> 03:43.690
OK that's good.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.250
That's a different error message.

03:45.480 --> 03:52.860
So the second argument is going to be the where we are passing the what we want to render but not where

03:52.920 --> 03:54.290
we want to render.

03:54.540 --> 04:00.380
So whenever we work with reactant just like I told before we are going to Gravatt just one single HVM

04:00.390 --> 04:05.230
L and we get to display everything inside that index HMO.

04:05.430 --> 04:12.780
So if I go to the index that each team how are going to see right here that I have a div that it's called

04:12.880 --> 04:20.080
root so re-act is going to graph all the components you have and it's going to put them right here.

04:20.280 --> 04:24.240
It's going to put all the other components right here inside the root.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.420
That's what we need to do.

04:25.530 --> 04:30.670
So we need to pass as a second argument to do it right here inside the root.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.280
You can call this whatever you want.

04:32.310 --> 04:33.250
It doesn't matter.

04:33.450 --> 04:39.160
So let's go to the index right here I'm going to say coma and we can begin to type document

04:41.730 --> 04:44.340
then dot and we can to use the Crace selector.

04:44.430 --> 04:49.250
And this is standard javascript Bennell javascript Kreiss selector.

04:49.440 --> 04:52.910
And then I'm going to pass the ID of root.

04:52.950 --> 04:53.860
We need to do that.

04:54.090 --> 04:57.880
It's called root.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.740
So if I just read the page OK.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.320
We get.

05:00.370 --> 05:02.000
Hello world.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.530
So again let's go back and just recap what's happening.

05:05.560 --> 05:09.910
We created a component that is going to be called app and this component.

05:10.020 --> 05:13.140
It returns just an H1 tag.

05:13.140 --> 05:17.730
Then we need to import some libraries or dependencies from react.

05:17.760 --> 05:18.980
And we are done.

05:19.410 --> 05:22.020
And at the end we are driving we are dumb.

05:22.140 --> 05:26.120
We are calling a render method that takes two arguments.

05:26.140 --> 05:31.510
What we want to output and the where we want to output that.

05:32.020 --> 05:33.220
OK that's fine.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.360
This is enough now.

05:34.380 --> 05:38.810
This is kind of the the beginning of re-act kind of simple.

05:38.820 --> 05:42.510
So that's why let's go to the next lecture and check something else.
