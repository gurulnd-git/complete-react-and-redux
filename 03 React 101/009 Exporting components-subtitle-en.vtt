WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:05.300
OK so the first component that we are going to create it's going to be beheader component.

00:05.550 --> 00:10.740
So we will pretty much follow the same steps we did with the index non-jazz.

00:11.040 --> 00:15.930
So we're going to use we can create a component that contains GSX.

00:15.930 --> 00:21.680
So to use it we need to import re-act from react so we can use GSX on this component.

00:21.780 --> 00:29.100
OK so I'm going to say import and I can say react from react.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.820
That's the first step.

00:31.730 --> 00:36.790
Then we need to create the component and just like with it personally I'm going to say Konst and this

00:36.800 --> 00:41.490
is since this is going to be a header component I'm going to say Hetter.

00:41.720 --> 00:42.230
OK.

00:42.590 --> 00:49.400
Then you get to say equal open and close equal and right pointing arrow and open and close call the

00:49.400 --> 00:51.860
braces are going to return.

00:51.860 --> 00:55.410
We always need to return something and I'm going to say dev.

00:55.510 --> 01:00.340
And inside here I'm just going to say Hetter to something simple.

01:00.340 --> 01:00.800
That's right.

01:00.800 --> 01:08.350
So we have the file we created a component and we are importing re-act from react.

01:08.390 --> 01:11.820
So we can use GSX on this on this component.

01:12.110 --> 01:20.150
So right now we need to graph this letter and show it on the screen whenever the application loads word.

01:20.210 --> 01:28.590
We have one problem this component it's going to be on a different file than the main index that jackass.

01:28.850 --> 01:31.840
So whenever you work would react.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.300
All the components are not connected.

01:34.460 --> 01:37.870
Unless you make we make a connection between them.

01:37.910 --> 01:38.440
OK.

01:38.750 --> 01:41.820
So we need to do kind of two steps.

01:41.870 --> 01:50.750
First we need to tell the application that this Hetter that yes it's accessible from other components.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.540
So we need to say something right here.

01:53.720 --> 01:59.690
So the way we do it is going to be calling an export going to say that we're going to use the keyboard

01:59.720 --> 02:07.780
export and then default an after the field begin to use the name of the components.

02:08.010 --> 02:09.610
So it's going to be better.

02:10.200 --> 02:18.090
So doing this we're telling the application that this Hetter can be used inside other components.

02:18.210 --> 02:24.780
So inside the index since we want to render the header component right here we need to bring the file.

02:24.840 --> 02:31.110
So I'm going to say right here components right here just like with that we react and we act dumb.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.920
We need to import the header components.

02:33.960 --> 02:41.370
So I'm going to say import and I'm going to make reference to the components we want to include which

02:41.370 --> 02:42.540
is going to be the header.

02:42.810 --> 02:50.100
And we can say from just like with it since this Hetter component is going to be inside a folder that

02:50.100 --> 02:54.290
calls component and not on the root directory of source.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.360
We need to make her.

02:55.380 --> 02:58.350
We need to actually build the path.

02:58.350 --> 03:04.260
So I'm going to say Dot for Slash and this is going to be inside components and it's going to be called

03:04.560 --> 03:10.160
Hetter that Jats whenever you call you call a component on a different file.

03:10.170 --> 03:12.800
Notice that I'm not putting jast right here.

03:12.960 --> 03:19.470
If you put just the name of the file without the Dangi Yes re-act already knows that you want to bring

03:19.560 --> 03:20.800
header non-jazz.

03:20.850 --> 03:23.660
So there's no need to put down the Jazz.

03:24.050 --> 03:25.450
OK that's good.

03:25.680 --> 03:31.710
So if I rewrote the page and getting an error message but what I'm getting it's going to be a warning

03:31.830 --> 03:35.060
we have right here the icon of warning it says header.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.280
It's defined but never used.

03:37.470 --> 03:45.600
So whenever you react it's it's considered bad bad coding bringing compliments importing components

03:45.900 --> 03:49.540
that components that are not used on the application.

03:49.830 --> 03:50.380
OK.

03:50.610 --> 03:52.430
That's the first thing.

03:52.430 --> 03:59.520
Now I'm going to show you something else before we include this component right here we are returning

03:59.670 --> 04:01.540
just in one tech.

04:01.770 --> 04:08.760
If I go right here and put the H one below the return going to really lower the application and it's

04:08.760 --> 04:11.020
going to fail you can have an error message.

04:11.250 --> 04:18.930
Whenever you use return like this you need to make sure that whatever it is after return has to be on

04:18.930 --> 04:20.070
a single line.

04:20.070 --> 04:23.310
So this works if you have a tiny element.

04:23.520 --> 04:30.570
All right but if you have a multi multi element just like I don't know maybe a div right here just two

04:30.630 --> 04:32.180
different elements.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.170
It's not going to work.

04:33.210 --> 04:35.120
So you need to do something else.

04:35.130 --> 04:36.070
What we can do.

04:36.120 --> 04:40.850
We can to open and close parenthesis going to make a space.

04:41.050 --> 04:41.910
I'm going to delete this.

04:41.910 --> 04:50.890
Just grab the H one caught and then right here I'm going to put it inside the parenthesis.

04:50.970 --> 04:53.020
And this is going to work.

04:53.140 --> 04:55.380
That's the first thing.

04:55.380 --> 04:57.160
Now there is one more thing.

04:57.390 --> 05:05.550
Whenever you are returning something some GSX inside a component you need to wrap everything inside

05:05.550 --> 05:07.230
one single element.

05:07.530 --> 05:14.140
If you pass two different elements just like to a div and maybe age 1 you can have an error message.

05:14.150 --> 05:14.600
Right.

05:14.610 --> 05:16.050
Doesn't like this.

05:16.230 --> 05:23.910
Re-act once for you to pass a single element and then inside this single element have everything else.

05:23.910 --> 05:29.010
So what we need to do we need to put everything inside one element.

05:29.100 --> 05:36.720
So I'm going to put everything inside a death inside as if we are passing one element and right here

05:36.780 --> 05:38.330
inside we have the h one.

05:38.460 --> 05:39.510
So this is working.

05:39.510 --> 05:40.610
It's going to work.

05:41.010 --> 05:48.250
Right now what we need to do on top of this one we need to import the head or we need to put the head

05:48.300 --> 05:49.410
right here.

05:49.410 --> 05:54.950
So it just like we did with app on the on the on the route ID.

05:55.010 --> 06:01.790
What I'm going to do going to call Hetter and then close just like that just like a tack.

06:02.490 --> 06:08.910
And since we imported the header components and we are specifying here that we want to use that component

06:09.220 --> 06:11.230
is going to render right here on the screen.

06:11.340 --> 06:12.510
So we have to Hetter.

06:12.730 --> 06:19.580
And I just make something else so we can make sure that that's the header we want OK.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.530
We get better.

06:20.710 --> 06:22.460
And then the H-1.

06:22.900 --> 06:23.400
All right.

06:23.440 --> 06:24.250
So this is working.

06:24.250 --> 06:27.430
So let's recap everything.

06:27.670 --> 06:28.880
We made a new file.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.760
It's called heterogeneous.

06:30.790 --> 06:34.900
We imported react so we can use GSX on this component.

06:34.900 --> 06:40.960
We created the components and then we made the component available for other components inside.

06:40.960 --> 06:50.710
We kept then on the main components and I'm using component a lot of imported the header inside the

06:50.910 --> 06:56.700
app components including everything inside a single elements inside the ring.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.600
The return of the render.

06:59.030 --> 07:00.400
OK that's good.

07:00.670 --> 07:04.560
So let's go to the next section and just move forward with this.
