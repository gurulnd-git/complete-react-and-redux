WEBVTT

00:00.590 --> 00:08.420
OK so I'm going to go to the letter that yes I'm going to delete what we did because we didn't we actually

00:08.580 --> 00:09.430
needed.

00:09.460 --> 00:15.620
So I'm going to go and delete the div and just leave the hetter component just as it is.

00:15.680 --> 00:21.580
We have the onchange and we are setting the state keyboard's just leave it at that.

00:21.590 --> 00:24.750
Now I see Ossa course resource.

00:25.160 --> 00:31.340
I've added a file so you can download is going to be adjacent file and we can use this as a database

00:31.430 --> 00:33.240
to render news.

00:33.260 --> 00:39.230
Now in the future if you're going to make the API calls real API calls we're not going to use a David

00:39.250 --> 00:41.660
that Jasen be going to use something else.

00:41.810 --> 00:45.810
But for now this is just as good as it gets.

00:45.820 --> 00:51.540
I gave you just download the DVD Jason and put it inside the source folder right here.

00:51.630 --> 00:54.100
David Jason inside source.

00:54.110 --> 00:56.570
Now what we need to do and I'm going to go.

00:56.590 --> 01:00.310
Just going to close this for now and go to the index that is.

01:00.410 --> 01:06.890
So we need to load the up whenever the application loads we are this is the first component that we

01:06.890 --> 01:08.960
can load the app component.

01:08.960 --> 01:18.380
Now what we need to do we need to fetch the news fetch the Jason database and we need to set a state

01:18.470 --> 01:25.940
with adjacent database and then from the state we need to pass the database to the list that it's going

01:25.940 --> 01:29.280
to be rendered right here now right here.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.380
Well we have a tiny problem.

01:31.520 --> 01:37.280
We need to convert this to to a class based component so we can use the state.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.450
So are we going to do some refactoring right here.

01:40.520 --> 01:45.890
I'm going to go first I'm going to import the Jason files so we can use it on the state.

01:45.890 --> 01:49.550
So I'm going to say import I'm going to give it a name of Jason.

01:49.670 --> 01:56.340
Now whenever you do an import this name is going to be whatever name you can put whatever right here.

01:56.340 --> 01:57.200
It doesn't matter.

01:57.410 --> 02:04.210
And javascript is five is going to create a constant with this value.

02:04.220 --> 02:13.520
So if I do Jason from and then it's going to be dot for Slash D-B that Jason this is just like doing

02:13.520 --> 02:18.670
Konst Jason equals to whatever we are fetching.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.810
All right.

02:19.910 --> 02:24.100
So OK so we import Jason right here it's giving us an error message.

02:24.110 --> 02:27.470
It's just a warning actually Jason is defined but never used.

02:27.470 --> 02:32.300
Remember we cannot have marbles that are not used in react.

02:32.450 --> 02:35.330
So just to make sure I'm getting the file correctly.

02:35.510 --> 02:39.720
I'm going to say cancel Don's log and inside the console log.

02:39.740 --> 02:42.710
I'm just going to output the Jason and whenever.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.570
OK so I'm getting to Jason.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.850
Let's get right here.

02:46.850 --> 02:53.120
So we need to convert this this app component from a statelets component from a functional component

02:53.480 --> 02:55.260
to a class based components.

02:55.410 --> 02:55.860
OK.

02:56.090 --> 03:02.970
So the first thing we need to do whenever we did this we do this we need to bring a component from react.

03:02.990 --> 03:09.470
So I'm going to go here I'm going to say components just like that component.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.050
Right.

03:11.540 --> 03:11.780
OK.

03:11.780 --> 03:17.400
So I'm going to just delete this and I'm going to just create a class.

03:17.540 --> 03:23.990
I'm going to say class and it's going to be app and then it's going to be extents just like it did before

03:24.200 --> 03:25.420
components.

03:25.710 --> 03:26.040
Right.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.040
So now we have our class.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.930
Now we're here to render something.

03:30.110 --> 03:34.910
So we use the render method it's render then parenthesis.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.930
And inside the curly braces we want to return something.

03:38.090 --> 03:41.720
So we're going to say return and inside the returns you want.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.350
We want to return a multi-line elements.

03:45.560 --> 03:50.860
We do parenthesis and inside the parenthesis we're going to do all the GSX.

03:50.930 --> 03:51.670
So OK.

03:51.950 --> 03:55.770
Now first we need to return the header.

03:55.790 --> 04:01.610
So I'm going to say Dev because we need to put everything inside just one element and mine it's going

04:01.610 --> 04:02.370
to be a div.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.320
You could have a span or whatever.

04:04.520 --> 04:11.930
And inside here I'm going to just return the header we have right here are header and when ever the

04:11.930 --> 04:14.360
application loads it's just going to work.

04:14.510 --> 04:16.100
We still have the Jason.

04:16.340 --> 04:21.840
So now what do we need to do is we need to create a constructor with a super and the props and set a

04:21.830 --> 04:22.990
new state.

04:23.020 --> 04:23.350
OK.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.680
So I'm going to go over here and we know this.

04:25.780 --> 04:28.820
Can you say constructor just like we did before.

04:28.850 --> 04:31.510
Can it create it and pass the prompts.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.570
All right.

04:32.620 --> 04:36.220
Inside here I'm going to call the super good.

04:37.650 --> 04:40.680
Kind of don't need this but that's fine.

04:40.990 --> 04:47.330
So I'm going to say this that state equals to news.

04:47.390 --> 04:48.810
My mind is going to be news.

04:48.820 --> 04:51.620
You can choose whatever name you want for here.

04:51.850 --> 04:57.700
And this is going to be equal to Jason but so we get no errors.

04:57.700 --> 04:58.620
So that is good.

04:58.630 --> 05:02.870
So when the OP starts we going to get this rendered with.

05:02.950 --> 05:07.330
And then of course he's going to do the Fadge he's going to bring all the files we already have right

05:07.330 --> 05:12.870
here and the state of news is going to be equal to the Jason we have right here.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.430
So now what we need to do we need to create.

05:16.750 --> 05:20.120
We need to import the news list to this.

05:20.200 --> 05:27.970
This indicates that James and from here we're going to fetch the import and we can pass it just like

05:27.970 --> 05:28.800
with it we'd better.

05:28.840 --> 05:36.660
We're going to do something like newsiest an inside news list right here as a prop you can begin to

05:36.910 --> 05:42.440
pass all the information we have right here in the state we're going to pass to state that is going

05:42.450 --> 05:44.350
to do something like this.

05:44.380 --> 05:47.930
So let's go to the next lecture and make this work.
