WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:07.770
OK so I'm going to talk about something else outside the re-act world right now.

00:07.880 --> 00:12.840
I'm going to talk about your six classes if you know about super and constructor.

00:12.920 --> 00:16.930
You can just move forward to the next lecture.

00:16.960 --> 00:24.410
I created a new Javascript can be called classes dodgiest and I've included this inside the team so

00:24.500 --> 00:27.980
I'm not going to react I'm going to show you this.

00:27.980 --> 00:29.720
And there's no need for you to copy.

00:29.750 --> 00:37.220
If you if you like to copy whenever you take to you to look at occurs the course the section just don't

00:37.220 --> 00:38.430
do it just pay attention.

00:38.450 --> 00:39.700
OK.

00:40.460 --> 00:47.750
I choose to show you this because if I go to the next section and call the in to the next topic which

00:47.750 --> 00:53.810
is going to be re-act state are going to be talking about constructor and super and you're not going

00:53.810 --> 00:55.000
to understand why.

00:55.180 --> 01:00.300
OK so let me just start writing some code and I'm going to explain you what we can do.

01:00.620 --> 01:03.000
I'm going to create a class of car.

01:03.050 --> 01:05.050
It's going to be class car.

01:05.180 --> 01:06.040
OK.

01:06.470 --> 01:08.860
And then just open and close.

01:09.020 --> 01:15.320
Inside this class we can have a function who's going to be called whatever function just a simple function

01:16.040 --> 01:21.260
and this function what it's going to do is go into console lock something that's going to be console

01:21.260 --> 01:21.780
log.

01:21.920 --> 01:27.010
Hey just something real simple and right here at the bottom are going to create a variable.

01:27.080 --> 01:33.760
It's going to be Konst car and it's going to be I'm going to create a new instance of this car.

01:34.150 --> 01:34.690
OK.

01:34.910 --> 01:43.890
So then if I called this instance of car and do dot and call that whatever function inside the console

01:43.910 --> 01:49.250
log we're going to get hey we are just triggering this so we create a new instance of this class and

01:49.250 --> 01:52.290
we are accessing the function inside this class.

01:52.310 --> 01:59.090
So this it's like working with constructor functions in iOS 5 and accessing maybe the prototype and

01:59.090 --> 01:59.700
whatever.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.130
So this is the main idea.

02:01.130 --> 02:09.380
What we need to do is to really to reproduce reproduce this and how to access the prototype in react

02:09.470 --> 02:12.760
with ESX to this is the main idea of deception.

02:12.890 --> 02:16.250
So in react we're not going to use Prototype anymore.

02:16.430 --> 02:18.630
We use the keyboard constructor.

02:18.790 --> 02:21.500
OK so I'm going to go right here at the top.

02:21.500 --> 02:26.300
And if you don't know what I'm talking about don't worry you're going to get it in a few seconds.

02:26.510 --> 02:31.070
I'm going to call to a method that's going to be called constructor.

02:31.070 --> 02:39.650
This constructor is going to have some settings inside and the settings it's going to be just some settings

02:39.710 --> 02:40.870
about a car.

02:41.150 --> 02:50.990
So this car is going to have some wheels so I'm going to say this wheels equal and has four wheels and

02:50.990 --> 02:57.090
we can say this and are going to make the type of the car is going to be a hatchback.

02:57.140 --> 03:03.140
Whenever you get a big car fan get the time.

03:03.140 --> 03:08.180
So I have a class I have a constructor and inside the constructor.

03:08.180 --> 03:17.550
I have some default settings so whenever I create an instance of car I have access to this settings.

03:18.090 --> 03:26.210
Now if I wanted to create a new class outside the car class I can go right here and create a class of

03:26.280 --> 03:30.850
for it just a brand and inside for it.

03:30.920 --> 03:35.970
What I want to do I want to bring all the settings of a car.

03:36.430 --> 03:41.440
OK I want to create this class create an instance of this like this.

03:41.690 --> 03:45.130
This class is for class going to do right here for it.

03:45.560 --> 03:49.830
And I'm going to create a new fort that's fine.

03:50.790 --> 03:55.860
So it's going to be for OK.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.960
So I just did the same thing.

03:57.980 --> 04:02.990
I created a Ford and I'm creating an instance of this Ford class.

04:03.020 --> 04:13.160
Now what I want to do whenever I use the Ford class I went to import all the default settings from car

04:13.880 --> 04:14.710
so car.

04:14.750 --> 04:18.710
It's going to be like a parent class for Ford.

04:18.890 --> 04:19.340
OK.

04:19.550 --> 04:27.280
So to make a connection between them I can say right here that Ford it's a child of car.

04:27.500 --> 04:32.520
And then what I'm when I use this class they want to bring all the information of cart.

04:32.660 --> 04:33.890
So what are we going to do.

04:33.890 --> 04:42.750
Again just like we did with that component it stands and we're going to bring car and so now forward

04:43.120 --> 04:44.580
it's the child of course.

04:44.590 --> 04:46.450
It's connected to car.

04:46.840 --> 04:54.550
Now inside here if I want to bring all the default settings right here that we have inside card but

04:54.550 --> 04:59.110
we need to bring it inside Ford what you can do I can call the constructor.

04:59.140 --> 05:04.230
So I'm going to say constructor and again right here.

05:04.260 --> 05:10.140
So the thing is that they should be working but it's not going to get a neural it can say must call

05:10.140 --> 05:14.910
super constructor interpret class before accessing this.

05:14.910 --> 05:21.000
The thing is that whenever we extend an element and we call the constructor we need to do something

05:21.000 --> 05:23.270
else which we call super.

05:23.580 --> 05:29.650
So if I go inside the constructor and do Super just like that I get no error.

05:29.870 --> 05:30.550
OK.

05:30.990 --> 05:39.060
Now if I go right here and do console log and I access the forward instance I have right here and I

05:39.060 --> 05:46.020
call the wheels since we are importing all the default settings from car we should be able to access

05:46.110 --> 05:47.120
the wheels.

05:47.160 --> 05:53.090
So I'm going to say Ford wheels if we reload the page I get for it.

05:53.250 --> 05:53.780
OK.

05:54.150 --> 06:02.160
So we can see with the extents the constructor and the Super we can bring default settings from a parent

06:02.190 --> 06:03.560
class.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.310
So this is pretty much what we can do would react.

06:06.360 --> 06:12.670
This is going to be like react for example and right here we can create an instance of react whenever

06:12.670 --> 06:19.810
we use react and it triggers the first instance of the application is going to kind of create a default

06:19.810 --> 06:22.990
class with a bunch of settings right here.

06:23.110 --> 06:25.500
And this is going to be called prompts.

06:25.540 --> 06:28.320
So this prompts I'm going to just put forth.

06:28.750 --> 06:31.300
It's going to be a lot of options we have for react.

06:31.570 --> 06:38.780
And this is provided by react and inside prompts we can have a lot of default settings for react.

06:39.070 --> 06:46.700
So whenever we create an X for example a header and we extend component it's going to be re-act component.

06:46.870 --> 06:53.710
So we can bring all the default settings from react to this component to our new components.

06:53.740 --> 07:00.160
So right here it's going to be better extents react and right here of course I need to do something

07:00.160 --> 07:01.560
else.

07:01.780 --> 07:07.780
It's going to be the cards can be of course Hetter and I'm going to just change everything too so it

07:07.780 --> 07:10.390
can make sense.

07:10.390 --> 07:20.830
So if we call Hetter react whatever function I think of AG There go react and then hetter instead of

07:20.830 --> 07:21.850
forward.

07:22.210 --> 07:30.070
We're going to get pretty much two valleys if I called the Petar that prompts I'm accessing this class

07:30.640 --> 07:35.760
and I'm calling the prompts but the prompts we're bringing all the prompts from super.

07:35.770 --> 07:42.430
From the parent class which is react this it's going to bring all the default settings from the re-act

07:42.430 --> 07:43.320
components.

07:43.570 --> 07:46.400
So this is the main idea.

07:46.470 --> 07:51.820
The main idea of state whenever we use re-act stayed and we're going to talk about re-act state.

07:51.850 --> 07:53.230
What are you going to do right here.

07:53.230 --> 08:01.870
We can call the constructor we can call the super and right here we're going to call the prompts and

08:01.900 --> 08:07.860
inside prompts we have access to all the default settings for react.

08:07.860 --> 08:08.340
All right.

08:08.410 --> 08:10.810
We're going to do that on the next section.

08:10.840 --> 08:14.710
Let's move forward to the next one and start using state.
