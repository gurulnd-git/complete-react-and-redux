00:00.360 --> 00:07.200
All right so finally what I want to do is to type something on the input and change the state.

00:07.230 --> 00:11.940
Now we already have a function to grab the event right here.

00:11.940 --> 00:17.250
We have an event that triggers a function whenever we change something on the input.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.010
All right that's that's it.

00:19.020 --> 00:25.860
So inside this function what we're going to do we're going to grab an instance of this state the state

00:25.860 --> 00:30.020
of the component and change the values inside keyboards.

00:30.020 --> 00:35.180
So OK I'm going to just delete this and right here to change this state.

00:35.220 --> 00:44.030
What we need to do is we need to do this we need to call the Diski ward and say Dot and do set state

00:45.370 --> 00:52.970
inside the same state we are going to open close the parenthesis and right here inside an object.

00:53.030 --> 00:55.480
What I'm going to do is say keywords.

00:55.570 --> 00:59.610
It's the same thing we have right here and now inside keywords.

00:59.640 --> 01:05.700
I'm going to just set the new state of keywords and see if we can't we have the event right here.

01:05.770 --> 01:10.410
We're just going to call event that target just like we did before.

01:10.540 --> 01:12.090
And then just the value.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.250
OK that's good.

01:14.260 --> 01:21.520
Now I get to reload the application and if I type something right here I'm going to get an error message

01:21.790 --> 01:26.700
cannot read properly set state of undefined and this is good.

01:26.980 --> 01:30.760
Now the thing is that you're calling this input function.

01:30.760 --> 01:38.360
And whenever we go right here input from interchange we're calling this and this means this function

01:38.890 --> 01:41.470
and we didn't have a state on this function.

01:41.470 --> 01:46.840
The state it's going to be inside the constructor of this class so we can use it this way we need to

01:46.840 --> 01:51.130
do something else and there's pretty much two ways to do this.

01:51.280 --> 01:56.340
I can assure you one way and maybe later on the application I can show you a different way of doing

01:56.350 --> 01:57.120
this.

01:57.130 --> 02:05.070
Now we need to create a relation right here with the this function and the actual class.

02:05.320 --> 02:10.000
So the way to do it we're going to go right here on the impot change and what I'm going to do I'm going

02:10.000 --> 02:15.290
to say Dot and I'm going to call the bind method and say bind.

02:15.790 --> 02:20.610
And inside the bind I'm going to say that OK.

02:20.890 --> 02:28.960
So this is what this is doing it's saying OK if I trigger the call this function I need to whenever

02:28.990 --> 02:36.640
inside this function if they say does this mean this class and not this function.

02:36.670 --> 02:38.630
That's why we do define this.

02:38.670 --> 02:42.010
You're kind of changing the behavior of this function.

02:42.010 --> 02:44.680
There's a different way to do this in six.

02:44.800 --> 02:49.930
But for now we're going to do it like this because maybe in the future you can use someone else's code

02:50.230 --> 02:55.480
and you're going to say that maybe they are doing this and you're not going to know why they're doing

02:55.510 --> 02:56.140
this.

02:56.170 --> 03:00.840
We're just making a relationship between the function and the actual class.

03:00.890 --> 03:06.710
So OK so if I go right here on the input I'm going to type I don't know John.

03:06.880 --> 03:07.440
OK.

03:07.480 --> 03:08.260
That's fine.

03:08.540 --> 03:10.450
We're not getting an error message.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.960
So this means that the said State it's working.

03:13.960 --> 03:17.080
We are changing the state the default state.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.610
So now keyboard's it's not empty anymore and it's going to be John.

03:21.970 --> 03:30.580
Now when when when you need to to change the default state to change state inside react you need to

03:30.580 --> 03:33.340
do it through set state.

03:33.340 --> 03:40.790
Now if you come from javascript to S-5 so maybe you have you have a different object right here and

03:40.800 --> 03:41.740
really have an array.

03:41.740 --> 03:46.150
For example you can do this movie DOD called the state.

03:46.240 --> 03:53.610
You can say this state for example then darte and you're going to do push and you push some values.

03:53.700 --> 03:56.910
Well in re-act this it's not allowed.

03:57.100 --> 04:00.250
It's going to work but you shouldn't do it this way.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.480
So this is a big big mistake.

04:02.500 --> 04:06.610
You shouldn't do it like this if you want to change a state.

04:06.700 --> 04:09.750
You always need to do it through set state.

04:09.760 --> 04:15.240
This is the method that re-act provides us to change to change a state.

04:15.490 --> 04:15.920
OK.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.870
That is get weird successfully changing the state.

04:19.870 --> 04:23.070
The thing is that I have no way to prove it right now.

04:23.140 --> 04:29.590
So we're going to go to the next lecture and we can to add some things so we can bew the we can check

04:29.590 --> 04:30.910
the estate changing.
