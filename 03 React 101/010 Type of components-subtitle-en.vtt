00:00.420 --> 00:04.640
OK so in fact we have two main types of components.

00:04.680 --> 00:08.280
We have functional components and class components.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.990
The difference is what you want to do with this.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.610
At this point this Hetter component is just a function.

00:15.660 --> 00:23.070
It's just receiving some data it might receive some data right here as an argument but it's not doing

00:23.070 --> 00:26.150
anything it's just returning some GSX.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.090
So this is a functional component.

00:29.280 --> 00:35.520
Now the functional component doesn't care what happens with the rest of the other components with the

00:35.600 --> 00:38.270
with the application it's just returned.

00:38.460 --> 00:40.920
Returning something or doing something.

00:40.950 --> 00:48.390
So on the other hand we have the class components disk components are a little bit more complex.

00:48.600 --> 00:54.400
They have the ability to know when it's happening on the rest with the rest of the application.

00:54.600 --> 00:59.210
So you may have right here in the index some information that it's going on right here.

00:59.430 --> 01:05.910
And then the hetter if it's a class based component is going to know what's happening inside react.

01:05.910 --> 01:08.900
That's why we're going to use class a class based components.

01:09.150 --> 01:15.390
Now inside our application we can have the header component and we can have a logo and we can have an

01:15.480 --> 01:16.210
input.

01:16.560 --> 01:23.400
So the user is going to inputs and text and we can grab whatever the user it's entering and we're going

01:23.400 --> 01:30.090
to pass these keywords to the news component and inside the news component we're going to search for

01:30.090 --> 01:32.130
a particular news.

01:32.250 --> 01:32.930
That's fine.

01:33.150 --> 01:38.970
So what we need to do we need to convert this header to a class based component.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.500
It could be a class based component.

01:41.520 --> 01:41.890
OK.

01:42.150 --> 01:46.740
So I'm going to delete all of this and I'm going to ride a class for this.

01:46.740 --> 01:54.270
So the first thing we need to do is to ride the keyboard class and the classes are not from do we react.

01:54.270 --> 01:57.300
This lesson is six some six.

01:57.300 --> 02:02.220
So first I'm going to assign a name to this class and I'm just going to open and close.

02:02.220 --> 02:04.720
Right now if you come from.

02:04.740 --> 02:05.490
Yes five.

02:05.550 --> 02:10.780
And you you're you're you're used to work with the constructor functions.

02:10.920 --> 02:14.000
Well this is pretty much the same idea.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.940
So now we're we have a class right here.

02:17.370 --> 02:25.740
And the thing is that to use this class we need to have a bind this class to react.

02:25.840 --> 02:33.340
So we want for this class to contain whatever re-act provides to this application.

02:33.420 --> 02:36.810
So we need to do something else to bind this to react.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.250
So what are we going to do.

02:38.250 --> 02:46.020
We're going to use the keyboard extents I'm going to say extends and since we want to extend extend

02:46.020 --> 02:53.740
to react I'm going to say react dart and we're going to use the word component OK.

02:54.190 --> 02:55.180
So very real.

02:55.210 --> 02:57.700
We get different a different message.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.010
That's good.

02:59.040 --> 03:04.550
Now we are creating the class and we are binding this class to react.

03:04.620 --> 03:07.490
That is get so now to return something.

03:08.010 --> 03:13.420
We do it in a different way than just the functional component.

03:13.440 --> 03:17.940
We can all do return and then return some GSX we need to do something else.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.690
What we need to do is really to use a render function.

03:21.690 --> 03:28.260
So I'm going to say render method because the render going to open and close the out the parenthesis

03:28.590 --> 03:30.840
and then curly braces.

03:30.940 --> 03:40.290
So if you notice this is kind of doing bar header that equals creating an object and having a render

03:40.380 --> 03:43.560
method that it's a function that returns something.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.250
If you come from.

03:44.280 --> 03:44.990
Yes 5.

03:45.090 --> 03:47.300
This is kind of doing something like this.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.000
OK.

03:48.030 --> 03:50.250
So inside are our render.

03:50.370 --> 03:51.900
We need to return something.

03:52.050 --> 03:59.130
So what we want to return is going to be the header components OK just like we did with the with the

03:59.370 --> 04:07.380
with the other returns you're going to say dev are going to create a header sorry head or tack up just

04:08.070 --> 04:09.320
just the header.

04:09.780 --> 04:14.120
And inside here we can have two things you can have the logo.

04:14.490 --> 04:18.540
And then we're going to have an input to simple as that.

04:18.760 --> 04:22.890
And look at and notice here that it's working in the index.

04:22.920 --> 04:30.430
It's importing the header and we are exporting this class of these components with some GSX.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.250
OK that is good.

04:32.580 --> 04:35.490
So now we get our input and logo.

04:35.490 --> 04:39.200
And if you come from S-5 notice that it's kind of like this.

04:39.240 --> 04:43.350
Inside right here we have the depth and the input.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.390
Okay that's good.

04:45.530 --> 04:46.890
When they just do this.

04:47.150 --> 04:47.590
OK.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.080
So now what we need to do.

04:49.100 --> 04:54.650
And there's one more thing that we can do to make this more professional right here.

04:55.020 --> 04:59.700
We are extending this class re-act that component.

04:59.700 --> 05:05.730
So pretty much we're entering the re-act object right here and getting the component.

05:05.730 --> 05:09.890
This is kind of something that it's inside the react.

05:10.080 --> 05:17.640
So what we can do we can just delete this and say components and right here on the import we get to

05:17.640 --> 05:20.510
make use of 6 destructuring.

05:20.700 --> 05:28.200
I'm going to say coma and then I'm going to open and close curly braces and then I get to say component's

05:30.130 --> 05:33.930
and if I reload the page this is still it's still going to work.

05:33.930 --> 05:40.460
So basically what it's doing right here it's entering react and it's just bringing the component.

05:40.500 --> 05:48.180
So there's no need to use it twice right here because we are already importing this component right

05:48.180 --> 05:49.300
here on the importance.

05:49.310 --> 05:50.800
There is no need to do this.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.960
And this is up to you.

05:53.220 --> 05:59.920
This is kind of a better because we are using sex directly some features of VSX but you can do re-act

05:59.930 --> 06:00.710
that component.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.500
It's actually up to you.

06:02.910 --> 06:03.170
OK.

06:03.180 --> 06:05.220
So everything it's good for now.

06:05.310 --> 06:12.710
We made this a component to this component a class based component and we are using it inside the app.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.750
The main app components.

06:15.980 --> 06:23.010
So let's get let's go to the next section and at some style to this Hetter because it's really really

06:23.130 --> 06:23.460
ugly.
