WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:08.760
OK so now what we need do we need to call this function of filter news from the the child component

00:08.840 --> 00:09.620
the header.

00:09.960 --> 00:10.400
OK.

00:10.500 --> 00:15.900
So in the previous lecture we made this function available through prompts.

00:15.990 --> 00:22.350
So what we can do right here we can call this function directly since we have it inside prompts we just

00:22.350 --> 00:23.420
can call it.

00:23.590 --> 00:23.920
OK.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.230
So how do we call.

00:25.290 --> 00:27.070
We hope we do this.

00:27.270 --> 00:32.020
And we called prompts and we're entering inside prompts right here.

00:32.250 --> 00:39.360
And the function is going to be called whenever we passed as yet as a prop. And here is going to be

00:39.360 --> 00:43.800
news search such as going to competence and paste it here.

00:44.030 --> 00:44.450
OK.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.610
So we're going to call you're calling this function right now.

00:47.610 --> 00:54.840
Now this new search takes a negative argument here it takes to keywords whatever we are typing right

00:54.840 --> 00:56.610
here as an argument.

00:56.670 --> 00:56.930
OK.

00:57.030 --> 01:01.840
So we have the event target that value inside this function.

01:01.980 --> 01:04.960
So we are going to pass whatever we are typing right here.

01:04.980 --> 01:08.360
We can do it with the state but I'm just going to pass the target.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.110
OK.

01:09.420 --> 01:15.710
So if I just reload the application again and go to the console and type iOS 6 for example.

01:15.930 --> 01:16.890
OK that's fine.

01:16.890 --> 01:18.640
I'm getting ESX.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.690
I'm just canceling lock the keyboards inside the function so we're good.

01:23.700 --> 01:24.590
We are on the good track.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.660
We are calling the new search and passing the arguments.

01:27.720 --> 01:31.540
Let's get some now inside the filtered news.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.800
We need to start filtering the news.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.800
I'm just going to delete this one second.

01:36.930 --> 01:37.560
OK.

01:37.980 --> 01:42.480
So I'm going to create a viable and we using iOS 6.

01:42.870 --> 01:47.220
I'm going to use Isak's filter the filter helper.

01:47.550 --> 01:50.330
So I'm going to say I'm going to create a viral that's going to be filtered.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.940
Just just something simple filter.

01:53.120 --> 01:53.930
OK.

01:54.330 --> 02:03.900
So we need to grab the state of news the state of news contains all the all the entrances all the news

02:04.320 --> 02:05.410
of the application.

02:05.550 --> 02:08.050
So I need to loop this.

02:08.080 --> 02:11.230
This state didn't use state and not the filcher of course.

02:11.580 --> 02:19.330
So I'm going to say this that state does news and then just call the helper Filcher.

02:19.600 --> 02:20.620
OK.

02:21.330 --> 02:29.220
This filter is going to take an item as an argument it's going to be each item on the loop on each loop

02:29.700 --> 02:33.020
and then it's just going to run a function.

02:33.090 --> 02:41.310
Now the filtered helper it's a helper that we can use to filter arrays or collections of data.

02:41.520 --> 02:46.410
So it needs to always return something always returned.

02:46.440 --> 02:50.430
We never use Filcher you just remember to use return.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.230
And this is not react.

02:52.230 --> 02:53.870
This is iOS 6 of course.

02:54.240 --> 02:54.760
OK.

02:54.840 --> 03:01.110
So what we need to do is we need to access each item OK on each loop.

03:01.110 --> 03:09.120
So we need to check the title which is going to be its title on each news and we are going to do something

03:09.120 --> 03:11.130
simple and nothing fancy.

03:11.130 --> 03:18.640
I'm going to say in the case of just the index off we know this is vanilla dance.

03:18.840 --> 03:27.750
So the index of is going to check if on the title on this all this string contains a wart like keyboards.

03:27.930 --> 03:28.420
OK.

03:28.530 --> 03:32.100
So I'm going to pass key keywords as an argument.

03:32.480 --> 03:39.510
And if it's greater than mine as one which is which means that it's true we're going to just return

03:39.510 --> 03:46.910
that cell and just cancel Lague the filter so we can make sure that it's filtering correctly it's going

03:46.920 --> 03:48.280
to reload the page.

03:48.300 --> 03:49.940
All right.

03:49.980 --> 03:50.990
One second.

03:52.410 --> 03:55.030
So I'm going to type E as 6.

03:55.380 --> 03:56.940
Ok that's fine.

03:57.210 --> 04:04.030
So we get first all the objects with the letter E as in the title and then just some.

04:04.050 --> 04:07.180
And the final result is going to be just one entry.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.900
So we are filtering correctly.

04:09.030 --> 04:11.500
We have six upgrade available.

04:11.610 --> 04:12.850
So it's working.

04:12.960 --> 04:20.580
Now what we need to do now that just close is we need to since we have our filtered list we need to

04:20.670 --> 04:24.970
pass this filtered to the state.

04:24.990 --> 04:31.680
We do have this filtered and set it as a state instead of Jason we can set this filter which is one

04:31.680 --> 04:33.920
entry to the Filcher state.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.340
How do we set state to remember.

04:36.780 --> 04:44.090
We can do this in reference to this component and then we set set state.

04:44.100 --> 04:44.940
All right.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.660
And then just open close.

04:46.710 --> 04:47.560
That's good.

04:47.990 --> 04:48.260
OK.

04:48.270 --> 04:56.070
Right here instead of I'm going to show you one thing first we're going to call the filtered state filter

04:56.130 --> 04:56.650
red.

04:56.870 --> 04:57.620
OK.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.560
Cut and paste just to avoid mistakes.

05:00.750 --> 05:07.070
And this filtered state is going to be equal to this version of all this filter.

05:07.780 --> 05:08.370
OK.

05:08.520 --> 05:12.800
And let me just reload the page a co-op.

05:12.840 --> 05:21.390
So if I type E6 is going to go right here to this function is going to Filcher and find inside the news

05:21.390 --> 05:26.440
stayed with all the news is going to find the ones in-house and have iOS 6.

05:26.670 --> 05:35.930
And then it's going to set the stage for Filcher which is the results just going to type in iOS 6.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.060
It's filtering is just showing one result.

05:39.060 --> 05:44.790
Remember right here we're just choosing to show the filtered instead of all the news.

05:44.790 --> 05:46.420
So it's working.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.530
I'm going to show you some.

05:47.530 --> 05:48.840
Some yes it's magic.

05:48.990 --> 05:54.120
Whenever you have an object and you have a key value pair with the same name.

05:54.320 --> 05:54.760
OK.

05:54.780 --> 05:58.780
In this case is key filtered and value filter.

05:58.830 --> 06:00.760
You just can delete the second one.

06:01.920 --> 06:09.070
And just leave one in six is going to know that the key is this has the same name for the value.

06:09.390 --> 06:09.820
OK.

06:09.980 --> 06:19.740
This is still going to work if I type ESX ESX it's going to find the first entry right here if I type

06:19.740 --> 06:22.440
iOS 6 in capitals is going to work.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.980
But if I do it in lower case it's not going to work.

06:25.980 --> 06:30.520
We didn't create a rule here to convert everything to lowercase.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.650
The Jason and the and whatever we are typing right here.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.620
So now just to save time.

06:36.640 --> 06:37.130
So OK.

06:37.170 --> 06:37.910
So it's working.

06:38.010 --> 06:39.180
Let's go to the next section.

06:39.200 --> 06:46.260
We're going to do a tiny conclusion of these very basic part of react and then we're just going to move

06:46.260 --> 06:46.800
forward.
