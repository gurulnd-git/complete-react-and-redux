00:00.160 --> 00:03.780
Guys so let's recap the things we covered so far.

00:03.780 --> 00:08.780
We used create re-act app to create a new voice or platform from react.

00:09.010 --> 00:12.870
And most of the people I know the developers I know they use this.

00:12.870 --> 00:17.940
They just start an application with create app including myself of course.

00:18.030 --> 00:24.920
So we've learned the importance about the imports in REACT to get re-act going.

00:25.050 --> 00:31.650
We created different types of component the components the class component and the function functional

00:31.650 --> 00:35.850
components we learned inside the class components.

00:35.850 --> 00:40.610
Some methods just like the Render to render some information on the screen.

00:40.710 --> 00:47.340
We used GSX And we've learned about some something about GSX that it's kind of a the team will look

00:47.340 --> 00:53.210
like we need to talk about events for example right here.

00:53.430 --> 00:58.240
The synthetic events the unclick and onchange events inside react.

00:58.290 --> 01:06.210
We used state with the constructor and super to use state to handle whatever's happening on the application

01:06.270 --> 01:10.520
to check to modify how the application behaves.

01:10.530 --> 01:15.120
We learned about prop's again constructor super and everything else.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.670
So we what else.

01:16.680 --> 01:21.560
We used some a lot of ESX features like destructuring right here.

01:21.570 --> 01:22.910
This is destructuring.

01:23.130 --> 01:27.900
We used to Filcher and we used that a lot of fire that Aro functions.

01:28.110 --> 01:30.290
So you know we did a lot of things.

01:30.360 --> 01:37.470
And right now if you want with this knowledge this basic knowledge you can just start creating an app

01:37.500 --> 01:38.210
on your own.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.790
Yeah course you can start now.

01:40.820 --> 01:43.360
There is a lot of more.

01:43.860 --> 01:46.320
There's a lot more of react.

01:46.350 --> 01:48.850
So we're going to be this is going to be a long course.

01:48.850 --> 01:50.130
This is just the basics.

01:50.220 --> 01:54.600
Now on the next section we can start with re-act router and Daury.

01:54.670 --> 02:01.650
We're going to cover pretty much the all the functionalities from Briac writer this section this basic

02:01.770 --> 02:08.620
part of the Course is going to be available this exact code is going to be available on get have.

02:08.640 --> 02:11.320
So you can download the basics for this.

02:11.340 --> 02:11.770
All right.

02:11.860 --> 02:16.050
OK so let's go to the next section and start with re-act router.
