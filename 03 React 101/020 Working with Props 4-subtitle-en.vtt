WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:02.860
OK so we have our list ready to go.

00:03.030 --> 00:07.470
But you know we made a file that should be hosting this item.

00:07.470 --> 00:14.370
Each item on the list and if we go to the planning we had right here we have a news component and inside

00:14.430 --> 00:18.730
we have a component that it's handling the item itself.

00:18.810 --> 00:22.180
So we need to just really factor a little bit.

00:22.410 --> 00:25.880
It's going to go right here just back to the project.

00:26.070 --> 00:26.690
OK.

00:26.910 --> 00:28.450
So I'm going to go to the news list.

00:28.500 --> 00:32.640
And again we just need to create a component for this.

00:32.640 --> 00:45.960
So again we're going to say import re-act from re-act now in real life when coding when using react.

00:46.200 --> 00:52.690
I just have snippets for this so I can just type two or three letters and I'm going to get the import

00:52.750 --> 00:55.330
back from Briac just have a template for this.

00:55.500 --> 01:00.240
I'm just typing on right now because I need you to do the same thing.

01:00.240 --> 01:03.800
Just type it all and then you just can create snippets for this.

01:03.990 --> 01:05.510
So I'm going to create a news item.

01:05.520 --> 01:10.960
It's going to be just a stateless function and we can create news item.

01:11.010 --> 01:18.930
Let's get it's going to be equal then we get it to fat are a function and right here we need to return

01:18.930 --> 01:19.540
something.

01:19.680 --> 01:25.130
So I'm going to say return and for now which is going to return a dip.

01:25.710 --> 01:26.090
OK.

01:26.100 --> 01:32.730
We need to export this news item and I'm going to I'm getting nervous just lemme see why.

01:32.730 --> 01:35.420
Because he's Konst go.

01:35.760 --> 01:40.530
I need to export this component so he can be available inside Newsless.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.280
So OK great here.

01:42.440 --> 01:48.700
Sport default default and then just a news item.

01:48.750 --> 01:49.910
So this is ready.

01:50.340 --> 01:53.270
So now inside here what are we going to do.

01:53.280 --> 01:58.950
Just like we did with the news list we're going to make a reference to this component to this news component

01:59.340 --> 02:01.550
and we're going to pass a props.

02:01.590 --> 02:03.320
The item we are looking.

02:03.390 --> 02:08.660
So this is going to save time right here and say props OK.

02:08.850 --> 02:09.750
That is good.

02:09.750 --> 02:15.710
Now since this component is available I need to go right here and import this component.

02:15.900 --> 02:22.500
So I'm going to say import and then just a news item from.

02:22.560 --> 02:29.080
And again since we're on the same directory right here we are inside the components directory because

02:29.080 --> 02:34.770
they don't force lasht and then just use this item or get to this component.

02:34.770 --> 02:37.000
It's ready to be used.

02:37.380 --> 02:45.420
So I'm going to copy all of this and go to a news list item and instead of just having a day of just

02:45.420 --> 02:47.020
going to paste it right here.

02:47.070 --> 02:47.300
OK.

02:47.310 --> 02:49.780
I'm getting a message that's why we are here.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.320
OK.

02:50.430 --> 02:51.330
So this is good.

02:51.330 --> 02:53.520
This should be working.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.860
It's not going to work.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.630
I'm going to tell you in a second why it's not working right here.

02:58.650 --> 03:06.300
Since we have a reference to a new news item we need to delete all of this and just like we did with

03:06.300 --> 03:12.750
the other components just right here we can include the component directly from here and I'm going to

03:12.750 --> 03:14.590
just open it close.

03:14.790 --> 03:15.740
That is good.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.240
Now what do we need to do.

03:18.490 --> 03:22.760
We need to pass this child component which is going to be this one.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.890
All the information that we are getting from them.

03:26.050 --> 03:26.640
OK.

03:26.910 --> 03:31.160
So we use actually do we do that pretty much the same thing.

03:31.380 --> 03:40.860
I'm going to say item is going to be equal to and we passed the item item is going to get this one and

03:40.860 --> 03:44.420
this is going to be the object of that news.

03:44.670 --> 03:45.200
Okay.

03:45.510 --> 03:48.180
Right here are going to need a key.

03:48.180 --> 03:52.440
Remember that we need to provide a key to each item.

03:52.440 --> 03:59.970
So I'm going to say again just item that ID and I get and that's going to work.

03:59.970 --> 04:02.910
Now we're having a lot of messages right here.

04:02.940 --> 04:09.210
I'm going to go back to the news list and the thing is that whenever we pass something to a child component

04:09.510 --> 04:14.730
it's going to be it's going to receive the the the data as props.

04:14.730 --> 04:23.070
So if I go right here just going to comment on this just to make sure I'm right here just going to return

04:23.070 --> 04:24.500
some time today.

04:25.230 --> 04:31.930
It's going to work but I'm just going to cancel log prompts.

04:32.510 --> 04:36.050
So let me make this bigger.

04:36.050 --> 04:36.880
There we go.

04:37.130 --> 04:37.890
So.

04:38.050 --> 04:38.390
OK.

04:38.390 --> 04:45.600
So whenever this component is loading we're getting the props and inside props.

04:45.710 --> 04:52.220
We have an object that's called it's called item and the item contains the information about each news

04:52.800 --> 04:53.630
now.

04:53.720 --> 04:57.360
So since we're using props we cannot use item.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.960
What we need to use it's props Dant item.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.020
And then just the information inside.

05:03.080 --> 05:12.350
So just let me go back right here going to say prompts Dant and the same thing right here prompts darts

05:12.950 --> 05:16.830
and props that it's going to work.

05:16.910 --> 05:23.780
It's working just fine now with E6 there there's something and B Actually we've been doing this right

05:23.780 --> 05:25.210
here inside component.

05:25.250 --> 05:31.960
We can make use of destructuring whenever we pass something an object as an argument.

05:32.030 --> 05:36.580
We can access the information inside directly from the arguments.

05:36.740 --> 05:42.950
Right here we are receiving prompts and prompts is just an object just like this is going to be prompts

05:43.340 --> 05:48.770
equals and then we have a child component that it can be item and it's going to have some information

05:48.770 --> 05:49.810
inside.

05:49.820 --> 05:58.750
So what we can do we can do this and make a reference make a reference to item.

05:58.780 --> 06:06.640
So whenever we are receiving this object we are just catching the item instead of prompts.

06:06.730 --> 06:12.510
The I'm sorry the item inside prompts and right here instead of making a reference to prompts which

06:12.510 --> 06:22.310
just make a reference to item is just to save code wrote oh I'm in mistake right here.

06:22.590 --> 06:25.910
If you read the application it's still going to work.

06:25.920 --> 06:32.160
So this is just destructuring it's real simple if you want that you can use props and then make reference

06:32.160 --> 06:36.170
to props not items that ID is actually up to you.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.080
So let's add some styling to this because it's really ugly.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.290
You're going to do something something real simple going to go to style.

06:43.410 --> 06:45.000
Going to go right here at the bottom.

06:45.000 --> 06:55.020
And I got to say news underscore item and then just to add I don't know maybe a painting of tiny pixels

06:56.370 --> 06:58.940
begin to do box sizing.

06:59.850 --> 07:00.270
There you go.

07:00.270 --> 07:02.770
Books I'm seeing bore the blanks.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.290
OK.

07:04.320 --> 07:13.050
And then just a just a line at the bottom border bottom and then a bottom and then it's going to be

07:13.110 --> 07:15.610
one pixel solid gray.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.400
Just something simple.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.790
Now we have this class we need to give.

07:20.890 --> 07:23.590
We need to use this class inside the components.

07:23.880 --> 07:29.550
So I'm going to go inside use list item and right here is inside each component.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.860
I can assign a class.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.840
So I'm going to delete the key because we don't need it.

07:34.860 --> 07:40.480
We already have it inside here and I'm going to just add a class name.

07:40.830 --> 07:46.250
So we say class name call to use item.

07:46.300 --> 07:46.600
OK.

07:46.690 --> 07:47.560
And that's better.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.000
But that's fine.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.170
So let's go to the next section.
