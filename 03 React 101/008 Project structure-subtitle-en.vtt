00:00.830 --> 00:08.180
All right so whenever you build this kind of apps it's very common to break everything into small components.

00:08.340 --> 00:13.800
So if you know Wordpress or any HP framework for example it's the same idea.

00:13.850 --> 00:18.050
We need to break everything into small pieces and then tie them together.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.440
This is very common for PH frameworks.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.590
It's same thing for react and other frameworks.

00:23.790 --> 00:26.850
So I'm going to give you I'm going to bring a chart right here.

00:27.450 --> 00:32.450
So this is when we were going to be creating at first just to learn the basics.

00:32.700 --> 00:38.040
We're going to have a parent component right on top of the chain and then we're going to add some things

00:38.040 --> 00:41.670
and begin to build kind of a news app.

00:41.720 --> 00:45.290
So on top and inside of the parent component.

00:45.390 --> 00:46.970
We can have a header.

00:47.000 --> 00:47.510
All right.

00:47.550 --> 00:51.320
And this is going to be a different component and that's the main idea of react.

00:51.330 --> 00:57.390
We have one component on top of the chain and inside we can have lots of components.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.880
So the first one is going to be the header.

01:00.030 --> 01:03.420
Let's get then besides the header.

01:03.440 --> 01:10.380
We're going to have the component that contains the news so we can have one big component for the news.

01:10.620 --> 01:16.140
And inside the news component you can have all the items inside the news component which is going to

01:16.140 --> 01:17.930
be each news.

01:17.940 --> 01:18.400
All right.

01:18.450 --> 01:21.720
So we have a punt component inside the parent component.

01:21.720 --> 01:28.410
We have two components one with Hetter and then the other one with the content of the news and inside

01:28.410 --> 01:29.470
the content of the news.

01:29.520 --> 01:34.050
We can have each news one component for each news.

01:34.050 --> 01:34.400
All right.

01:34.460 --> 01:35.250
That's good.

01:35.550 --> 01:37.880
So you know this is this is fine.

01:37.890 --> 01:43.900
This is just a simple structure but this is kind of a small but we're going to start small at the beginning

01:43.960 --> 01:45.890
just you know baby steps.

01:45.980 --> 01:49.790
And in real life this is going to get really confusing.

01:49.830 --> 01:52.560
You can have a lot of components going around.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.410
So it's going to be kind of messy but that's fine.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.840
That is just until you get used to it.

01:57.930 --> 01:58.270
OK.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.260
Don't worry.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.630
So I'm going to go back to our project right here.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.280
Let me just bring the color world.

02:04.320 --> 02:04.940
OK.

02:05.170 --> 02:10.250
And inside the project structure I'm going to start doing some things now.

02:10.290 --> 02:15.860
The first thing we need to do is to create a folder called components.

02:16.080 --> 02:24.340
And some people call it buse or includes or templates components imbues are the most popular ones.

02:24.360 --> 02:32.160
So we're going to use components inside source folder I'm going to create a new folder that called components

02:33.880 --> 02:42.360
right inside the components folder and it create all the components that we can use to build the application.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.330
So OK so first we begin in the header.

02:45.450 --> 02:50.480
So I'm going to say Hetter that day as well.

02:50.500 --> 02:54.360
JS The old thing is going to be the news component.

02:54.480 --> 03:00.630
So I'm going to create a new file and this one is going to be called news underscore list.

03:00.670 --> 03:01.770
Yes.

03:02.400 --> 03:06.860
And then inside the news list we're going to have one component for each news.

03:06.870 --> 03:18.470
So again just can it create new file and say news the underscore list on score item that has that site.

03:18.480 --> 03:25.980
So this is what we're going to be begin to do at first in the index where we have the me go back where

03:25.980 --> 03:27.820
we have the app inside here.

03:27.930 --> 03:32.550
It's going to be kind of the parent component and inside the parent component we can have the header

03:32.820 --> 03:37.530
and then use list and then inside the useless begin can have each item.

03:37.530 --> 03:38.560
All right that's fine.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.460
So let's go to the next section and start building this.
