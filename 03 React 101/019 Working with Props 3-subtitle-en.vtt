WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:08.510
OK since we have our props data with all the news array what we need to do is to grab this props and

00:08.570 --> 00:09.880
access to news.

00:10.220 --> 00:14.240
And with the news we can a loop that array and show all news.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.990
So I'm just going to delete the consulate probs.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.650
They're going to go right here.

00:18.740 --> 00:23.180
Now what we want to do we want to create a variable that is going to loop this.

00:23.510 --> 00:30.440
So we're going to go right here and going to see a concert and this concert is going to be items you

00:30.440 --> 00:32.710
can put whatever name you want.

00:32.750 --> 00:39.230
Now since we're using iOS 6 We're going to make use of the map help her if you know what I'm talking

00:39.230 --> 00:40.160
about.

00:40.730 --> 00:46.190
If you know the map Well it's going to be easier for you if you just stick around.

00:46.190 --> 00:47.820
I'm going to explain what is happening.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.270
So first we have the prompts with all the information.

00:51.380 --> 00:53.270
So we need to access the prompts.

00:53.270 --> 01:00.530
Just like an object we need to access the news and then we can a map over it with the map.

01:00.530 --> 01:07.370
Of course we're going to use an item and we're going to make use of your sex and I'm going to say OK

01:07.460 --> 01:15.320
we want to loop each this array and create an item for each one and it's going to be equal and right

01:15.320 --> 01:18.700
pointing arrow because it's going to be a fat a function.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.190
And inside here we're going to do all the logic.

01:21.560 --> 01:28.500
So since we want to return some GSX going to say return and everything is going to be inside a parenthesis.

01:28.940 --> 01:32.950
Ok now I'm going to do div an inside here.

01:32.960 --> 01:37.860
You can have return all the the the elements inside a container.

01:38.210 --> 01:44.930
So I'm going to say first I'm going to grab an H-3 tack and I going to make reference to the item and

01:44.930 --> 01:46.370
just let me check the date.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.360
Jason you can have an ID a title and a field.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.190
So I get to make reference first to the title.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.570
So I'm going to go right here and use curly braces.

01:56.720 --> 02:02.720
I'm going to graph this item DOD and make reference to the title and.

02:02.750 --> 02:03.920
OK that's good.

02:03.950 --> 02:04.990
So I'm going to go right here.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.030
Karelian you did and this is going to be the field which is going to be text.

02:10.130 --> 02:10.490
OK.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.710
I'm going to go right here.

02:11.990 --> 02:16.260
Curly braces item don't feed.

02:16.870 --> 02:17.410
OK.

02:17.600 --> 02:25.410
So this function is going to loop over the news the news with the map function map helper.

02:25.730 --> 02:30.060
And we will create this markup for each use.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.140
You can have just four news.

02:32.530 --> 02:32.960
OK.

02:33.050 --> 02:36.230
So how can I just render this.

02:36.620 --> 02:38.030
This elements.

02:38.060 --> 02:47.660
So inside here we need to I'm going to delete newsiest and remember that re-act needs for us to return

02:47.780 --> 02:49.170
just a single element.

02:49.350 --> 02:57.170
If I do this and just do a curly braces and make a reference to this viable I'm going to show you just

02:57.170 --> 02:57.790
now.

02:59.090 --> 03:03.430
Begin to get an error message about that element must be returned.

03:03.560 --> 03:10.160
This is because whenever we call this novel this comes out items it's going to loop through this and

03:10.160 --> 03:15.050
it's going to give us back just three elements just like this.

03:15.050 --> 03:20.490
And remember re-act wants us to pass a single element just a wrapper just in a container.

03:20.690 --> 03:24.580
So I'm going to go right here I'm going to say make it.

03:24.650 --> 03:26.930
I'm going to create a container.

03:27.820 --> 03:34.970
And inside the container we can have all our items and we are getting them just a title and feed and

03:35.160 --> 03:36.670
we get all four that's.

03:36.710 --> 03:40.880
So it's working if you know how map works.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.540
Just go to the next section.

03:42.740 --> 03:45.170
If you don't know what's happening right here.

03:45.170 --> 03:45.900
Just stick around.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.830
I'm going to I'm going to tell you right now what is happening.

03:49.220 --> 03:49.840
OK.

03:50.240 --> 03:58.910
So with iOS 6 and the later version versions of iOS 5 we already have access to map map.

03:58.910 --> 04:02.160
It's just kind of a loop this map.

04:02.180 --> 04:06.470
It's going to be equal to do a for loop for example.

04:07.200 --> 04:07.630
What happened.

04:07.650 --> 04:07.850
OK.

04:07.880 --> 04:13.940
For an inside for create a viral and it's called I it's going to be equal to zero.

04:14.270 --> 04:16.590
And then we just call until I.

04:16.610 --> 04:22.380
It's less than a ray ray dot that length.

04:22.540 --> 04:23.530
Length.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.010
We get it.

04:25.240 --> 04:28.960
I plus plus an inside here for each iteration.

04:28.970 --> 04:33.470
And that every You're going to return the of course the elements.

04:33.740 --> 04:37.980
So this is the same as doing this just can come in this.

04:38.010 --> 04:38.630
OK.

04:38.870 --> 04:45.190
So again we have the props and inside the props we have something that calls prompt news.

04:45.380 --> 04:50.390
It's an array so we access proper use and then we use a helper.

04:50.390 --> 04:54.110
It's going to be map then for each iteration.

04:54.170 --> 04:57.480
On this loop we pass an item.

04:57.820 --> 04:58.170
OK.

04:58.220 --> 05:02.110
So first one is going to be the first and use and that it's item.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.330
So we're going to go right here and we will return some code.

05:05.390 --> 05:10.520
So it's going to go on the first iteration is going to access the item which is the first element on

05:10.520 --> 05:16.990
the array and it's going to give us the title of this first and the first item and then the feed.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.270
And then it's going to go here.

05:18.290 --> 05:19.560
It is going to start again.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.260
It's going to go to the second round.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.820
It's going to grab the item.

05:22.880 --> 05:27.900
The second item and it's going again pass the title and the feed.

05:28.070 --> 05:30.910
It's going to do it four times with the four news.

05:30.950 --> 05:38.410
And then at the end of course it's going to return all the four news just like this.

05:38.450 --> 05:42.550
Re-act is grandis and it's just putting the items right here.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.090
OK.

05:43.130 --> 05:46.740
Let me just go back.

05:46.910 --> 05:48.160
So this is happening again.

05:48.170 --> 05:55.830
Map it just like doing this but in ESX going in the did this picture site it's kind of a ballroom see

05:56.260 --> 05:57.120
this.

05:57.520 --> 06:01.600
This right here pretty much item just like this.

06:01.730 --> 06:03.340
And then a fat function.

06:03.470 --> 06:08.820
It's like doing props that I believed was news.

06:09.170 --> 06:16.330
Use that map and then when we do this it's like doing function and then just returning the function.

06:16.340 --> 06:19.700
This is the same syntax but in the A-6.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.210
OK that's fine.

06:21.230 --> 06:26.110
That's a little bit of information about the map and right here.

06:26.180 --> 06:34.340
It's working but we are getting an error message you're getting each child in an array or iterator should

06:34.430 --> 06:36.450
have any unique key.

06:36.470 --> 06:38.910
Now whenever we worked we'd react.

06:38.990 --> 06:41.750
And we do and we loop items.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.940
Each item that we are returning needs to have a key.

06:46.130 --> 06:47.840
And this is just for react.

06:47.960 --> 06:48.620
OK.

06:48.620 --> 06:53.160
You're not going to see this key inside the inside Saddam.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.520
Maybe if you inspect it.

06:54.710 --> 07:02.200
So if I go right here he's going to say OK we need to add a key prop props are this the same thing we're

07:02.240 --> 07:04.100
passing right here on the index.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.480
This is a prop.

07:05.630 --> 07:13.170
So what we need to do whenever we do a loop we need to have a prop that has the name of key.

07:13.390 --> 07:17.060
So going to say key and just return something.

07:17.240 --> 07:21.340
Since on our database each item has an ID.

07:21.440 --> 07:22.850
I'm just going to pass the ID.

07:22.880 --> 07:29.060
It's going to be item dot I.D. and we're going to get rid of that error message.

07:29.230 --> 07:30.090
Let's get.

07:30.140 --> 07:37.330
So everything is working for me just make this a little bit smaller we said to default.

07:37.390 --> 07:37.720
OK.

07:37.730 --> 07:39.820
And we had we have all the news.

07:40.220 --> 07:40.460
Right.

07:40.460 --> 07:45.350
So let's go to the next section and talk about something else that prompts.
