WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:07.080
OK so before I forget I've added some styles to the input I forgot to do it on the Preuss Lechter I've

00:07.080 --> 00:11.950
added to just the font size and then just a margin of 20 something real simple.

00:12.170 --> 00:12.570
OK.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.060
So we're going to talk about events whenever we work with applications.

00:16.080 --> 00:23.850
Events are really important you know events to how to get whenever we get whenever the user clicks or

00:23.850 --> 00:28.330
whatever the user types some information we want to get that event.

00:28.620 --> 00:33.120
So whenever the user clicks the logo I want to do something.

00:33.480 --> 00:33.740
OK.

00:33.780 --> 00:36.430
So this is just like vanilla jazz.

00:36.480 --> 00:42.050
And for those who don't know what jazz is it's raw javascript it's S-5.

00:42.060 --> 00:43.950
We're using iOS 6 right here.

00:44.160 --> 00:44.660
Vanilla.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.000
It's going to be fine.

00:46.260 --> 00:46.700
OK.

00:46.890 --> 00:53.920
So just like iOS 5 what do we do we need to get the on click handler back in.

00:53.970 --> 00:54.670
Yes 5.

00:54.690 --> 00:55.320
What do we do.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.980
It's unclick just like this.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.740
And then inside here we just write a function and that's it.

01:01.770 --> 01:08.640
And then maybe in a different file we use function and then click and then we just trigger the function

01:08.970 --> 01:13.310
right just like we used to do it there.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.280
The thing is that we are using react.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.830
So we are not going to be able to do it this way.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.130
We need to do something else.

01:20.310 --> 01:25.350
So I'm going to let this go back and really want to get the On Click event.

01:25.500 --> 01:31.860
So I'm going to say on end in camel case I'm going to say click and this is equal and it's equal to

01:31.860 --> 01:32.680
a function.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.760
So we need to use curly braces.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.270
I'm going to show you two ways.

01:36.270 --> 01:40.090
Kind of an inline method and then an import let's say import.

01:40.340 --> 01:46.900
OK so I want to cancel Lague whenever the user clicks on the on the logo.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.960
So I want to trigger a function.

01:48.960 --> 01:53.760
And since we're using iOS 6 I'm going to make use of fat functions.

01:54.030 --> 01:54.770
I'm going to do.

01:54.870 --> 02:00.210
I'm going to write here inside the braces I'm going to open and close parenthesis and then going to

02:00.210 --> 02:03.190
say equal and then right pointing arrow.

02:03.450 --> 02:07.220
And since I want to trigger a function I'm going to do curly braces.

02:07.600 --> 02:08.240
That's good.

02:08.430 --> 02:13.340
So I want to do cancell log and then and when she is just Consolo click click.

02:13.410 --> 02:17.010
Let's get to something simple right.

02:17.130 --> 02:19.750
If I just reload the page and click the logo.

02:19.830 --> 02:20.760
OK that's working.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.120
We get clicked.

02:22.290 --> 02:28.970
So pretty much right here we are just saying I wanted to just trigger this function and if with ESX

02:29.010 --> 02:35.910
whenever you have a single expression you can get rid of the curly braces right here.

02:35.910 --> 02:38.720
If you have the click works ok.

02:38.790 --> 02:45.210
If you have more expressions like maybe a two virals or two consulate's or something like that it's

02:45.210 --> 02:47.970
not going to work because you have more expressions.

02:47.970 --> 02:50.960
Whenever you have one you can use it like this.

02:51.540 --> 02:52.560
And this is going to work.

02:52.620 --> 02:53.570
You're going to do.

02:53.570 --> 02:57.770
You're going to call the On Click event and then you just trigger the function.

02:57.990 --> 02:58.570
Right.

02:58.950 --> 03:02.300
So I want to show you a different way what I want to do.

03:02.520 --> 03:08.530
I want to get what the user it's typing right here whenever they just type.

03:08.610 --> 03:09.190
OK.

03:09.300 --> 03:12.570
And that's asking if we're going to use the onchange handler.

03:12.870 --> 03:23.000
Now back in iOS 5 we will we do it on a different way we call to a different method is going to be an

03:23.040 --> 03:23.610
event listener.

03:23.610 --> 03:29.640
We create create an event listener that's going to have the onchange listener the onchange event and

03:29.640 --> 03:33.920
then we pass the event to get what the user is typing.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.700
That is what we used to do back in the S-5.

03:37.080 --> 03:40.900
Now right here with react we do it on a different way.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.620
We need to change everything.

03:42.630 --> 03:48.650
So again I need to call to get the event and we want to get the On Change event.

03:48.810 --> 03:54.540
So I'm going to say on am I going to say change right.

03:54.930 --> 04:02.880
And since you want to trigger function going to use curly braces I wanted to call to a function to trigger

04:02.880 --> 04:11.310
a function that is going to call input change to something like that the name makes sense.

04:11.610 --> 04:14.620
And whenever the user change changes the impot.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.210
I went to council log.

04:16.410 --> 04:22.830
Hey now I'm going to get an error message because this is empty.

04:22.860 --> 04:27.180
So what I want to do I want to call this function whenever they change it.

04:27.250 --> 04:27.560
Get.

04:27.600 --> 04:33.120
So if I copy this and paste it right here it should be working but its not.

04:33.150 --> 04:35.040
We cannot use it this way.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.530
It says interchange.

04:36.570 --> 04:39.050
Its not defined so we act.

04:39.090 --> 04:47.430
Its not finding this function and this is because we need to put a reference to tell re-act where to

04:47.430 --> 04:52.230
find this function so we can use this keyword.

04:52.940 --> 04:58.460
So if we use this it works and if I just click something OK.

04:58.980 --> 04:59.590
We're going to get.

04:59.620 --> 05:02.670
Hey the thing is that we're going to get just one time.

05:02.710 --> 05:04.090
So would react.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.050
We just did this.

05:06.310 --> 05:13.050
And if I just reload the page and type we're going to get it many times so this is working.

05:13.080 --> 05:20.880
Now this keyboard it's really important whenever we use this we are telling react to look for this function

05:21.250 --> 05:29.980
inside this class so that this keyboard means OK I'm inside this component so find just find a function

05:29.980 --> 05:37.020
that calls impot change inside this class whatever the component is.

05:37.030 --> 05:42.220
So it's going to enter the class Hetter is going to find the impot change and then it's going to trigger.

05:42.300 --> 05:42.920
That's good.

05:42.940 --> 05:44.200
So it's going to work.

05:44.410 --> 05:52.180
Now back in again back in the is yes five Rigol way we with things we call the event listener and we

05:52.180 --> 05:53.400
pass an event.

05:53.560 --> 06:01.420
So just here we pass an event and inside here since I want to get what the users type is typing I'm

06:01.420 --> 06:02.850
going to call that event.

06:02.970 --> 06:09.100
I'm going to say Dot I'm going to get the target and dot the valley just like we used to do it back

06:09.100 --> 06:09.830
and he is fine.

06:09.980 --> 06:14.880
And if I just type g g h t y whatever.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.570
So that's good.

06:16.600 --> 06:24.250
Now this is working but there's something else with this whenever we called this event back in iOS 5

06:24.610 --> 06:31.930
we're calling the event of the window object we are AXS in the window and then getting the events directly

06:31.930 --> 06:35.420
from the browser directly from the DOM.

06:35.650 --> 06:44.830
One of the features or things about react is that you're not allowed to interact with the DOM directly.

06:44.980 --> 06:52.270
You need to do it through we act we act is going to grab this event handler is going to go to the Dom

06:52.360 --> 06:54.690
and then just make the associations.

06:54.700 --> 07:02.780
So if I just delete this and just check the event just type G begin to get this.

07:03.360 --> 07:08.120
And it's kind of a different this can save re-act don't the component.

07:08.350 --> 07:14.740
And we can get all the handlers to target and whatever Allaf information and this keyword synthetic

07:14.830 --> 07:17.100
event it's what we are getting.

07:17.140 --> 07:23.380
We are not working with the Dom and the events directly with the window directly.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.500
We are working with react and then react.

07:26.540 --> 07:30.760
It's connecting with the Dom and doing what we want.

07:30.790 --> 07:32.850
So we have a I have a link right here.

07:32.860 --> 07:34.390
You can check this out.

07:34.600 --> 07:40.960
Just let me go right here and I'm going to go to the re-act docs.

07:41.390 --> 07:41.910
You can have.

07:41.910 --> 07:49.660
You can have a section with synthetic vents it can have all the examples right here and right here.

07:49.740 --> 07:51.330
You to support advance.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.260
You can have all the events around.

07:54.430 --> 07:57.380
So we were using the unclick and the onchange events.

07:57.400 --> 08:01.890
So that's the two of these events so you can you can check the docs.

08:01.900 --> 08:02.410
OK.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.560
So there's a lot a lot of information.

08:04.840 --> 08:09.750
So pretty much in a nutshell again we are just triggering a function.

08:09.880 --> 08:15.070
It's accessing the synthetic events of react and then react is connecting with the Dom and it's going

08:15.070 --> 08:21.400
to give us the information of what we are typing inside the the input.

08:21.400 --> 08:25.130
So again it's even that target that value

08:28.520 --> 08:29.460
OK.

08:29.780 --> 08:30.130
Right.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.110
That's working.

08:31.550 --> 08:34.290
OK so let's go to the next section.

08:34.340 --> 08:40.600
Begin to talk about something really really important for yakked.

08:40.910 --> 08:48.020
First I'm going to add a section that it's going to begin to talk about constructors begin to talk about

08:48.020 --> 08:57.860
classes if you know ESX if you know how to work with classes inside ESX you can skip the next lecture

08:57.950 --> 08:59.670
and go to the next one.

08:59.670 --> 09:00.280
All right.

09:00.290 --> 09:04.690
If you don't know anything about classes just stay.

09:04.730 --> 09:07.010
Just take a look of funding to the next section.

09:07.100 --> 09:13.850
We're going to talk about the classes because if I go to the next topic which is going to be the re-act

09:13.880 --> 09:18.070
state you're not going to get it that easily.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.490
Let's go to the next section.
