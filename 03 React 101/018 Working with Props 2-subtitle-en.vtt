WEBVTT

00:00.220 --> 00:06.720
OK so we have our main app components class based components and whenever the application loads it's

00:06.720 --> 00:11.940
going to just start from this one you're going to render the header just like what you are right now.

00:12.120 --> 00:17.710
And inside here just after the header we are going to bring a child component just like Hetter.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.510
And it's going to be the news list.

00:19.830 --> 00:26.070
Now to this we're going to pass to this Newsless components all the information we're getting on the

00:26.070 --> 00:26.640
state.

00:26.640 --> 00:32.280
The news is going to be the Jason file of your fetching and we can get from the useless components.

00:32.290 --> 00:33.880
We're going to grab this Jason.

00:34.020 --> 00:36.960
We're going to lose the Jason and show all the news.

00:37.050 --> 00:39.180
That's what we can do right now.

00:39.180 --> 00:45.150
So if I go to news list and this is one of the most important questions that you should ask yourself

00:45.390 --> 00:52.650
whenever you create a component it it's do I need a functional stateless component or a class based

00:52.680 --> 00:54.000
components.

00:54.130 --> 01:02.170
Now it's considered bad coding in re-act creating a class based component and not using state.

01:02.430 --> 01:07.260
If you're not going to use this state there's no need to use a class based component.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.160
You just use a functional just to function.

01:10.170 --> 01:14.970
The thing is that the news that we're going to receive adjacent file on the newscast and we're going

01:14.970 --> 01:16.550
to loop that and showed that use.

01:16.590 --> 01:19.770
So we don't need class based components.

01:19.770 --> 01:26.190
Now if we use a class based component and not using the state we're going to make this component more

01:26.190 --> 01:33.000
heavier and it's going to of course take it's going to consume much more memory.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.890
So yeah we're going to make it functional components.

01:36.220 --> 01:36.560
OK.

01:36.570 --> 01:39.550
So the first thing we need to do to create a component.

01:39.570 --> 01:41.360
Just let me say this.

01:41.510 --> 01:44.840
It's import react because we can use GSX.

01:44.910 --> 01:50.500
So I'm going to say import re-act from react.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.010
Right.

01:51.060 --> 01:53.430
So that's that's the first step.

01:53.430 --> 01:55.870
So first we need to create a component.

01:55.920 --> 02:01.080
And since it's a functional I'm going to create Kunst and mine is going to be called it's going to be

02:01.080 --> 02:02.740
called newsiest.

02:03.030 --> 02:03.470
That's fine.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.430
So this makes sense.

02:05.610 --> 02:07.140
This is going to be equal.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.740
We're going to have an empty.

02:09.150 --> 02:11.690
And then just right pointing arrow.

02:12.120 --> 02:12.690
OK.

02:12.930 --> 02:14.530
So it's a fun hour of function.

02:14.530 --> 02:15.270
That's good.

02:15.480 --> 02:19.730
So this news list is going to return some GSX.

02:19.740 --> 02:24.340
So what we're going to say we're going to retune return the new list.

02:24.450 --> 02:25.250
That's good.

02:25.740 --> 02:32.400
Now since we have our functional components we need to export this useless component so it can be available

02:32.490 --> 02:33.800
on the index dodgiest.

02:33.940 --> 02:45.720
So we're going to go right here miss a sport default and then just newsiest right now this component

02:45.780 --> 02:47.150
it's exported.

02:47.310 --> 02:50.010
So in the index so we can use that component.

02:50.010 --> 02:52.230
We need to import that newsiest.

02:52.290 --> 02:58.480
So I'm going to say import this list let's make it right.

03:00.810 --> 03:01.150
Right.

03:01.170 --> 03:05.400
That's right and didn't make capital make more sense.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.630
So it's going to be from.

03:06.780 --> 03:12.810
And again d'arte for Slash components for Slash and it's inside and useless.

03:12.930 --> 03:13.510
Let's get.

03:13.510 --> 03:16.950
So this component its ready to be used.

03:16.950 --> 03:22.920
So going to copy this component is going to go right here at the header and again to say Newsless going

03:22.920 --> 03:25.080
to just open close.

03:25.080 --> 03:25.530
All right.

03:25.710 --> 03:32.900
So if the application loads we are getting news lists so this component is just kind of ready.

03:33.120 --> 03:41.480
Now what we need to do we need to kind of a pass whatever we are getting the news that Jason from news

03:41.490 --> 03:42.380
that Jason.

03:42.540 --> 03:47.310
So inside re-act there is something that calls prompts prompts.

03:47.310 --> 03:53.670
We can use prompts to pass information to child components or to different components.

03:53.670 --> 03:59.070
So inside here what I want to do is to pass the state news.

03:59.280 --> 04:05.160
So I'm going to go right here inside the news list and what I'm going to say it's going to be news and

04:05.160 --> 04:12.660
this news is going to be equal to something so right here we need to pass the state of news.

04:12.750 --> 04:20.430
So I'm going to make reference to this dot state DOT use.

04:20.590 --> 04:27.400
Ok so I'm going to go again to Newsless component and we need to receive whenever we create this component

04:27.720 --> 04:30.200
we need to receive this data.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.390
This prompts.

04:31.630 --> 04:32.140
OK.

04:32.290 --> 04:38.040
So is I here just in a sense this is just a function we can get arguments.

04:38.040 --> 04:44.740
So I'm going to say prompts So whenever this component it's rendered on the screen is going to have

04:44.740 --> 04:47.260
some default arguments.

04:47.260 --> 04:56.260
So if we go right here and say console log and then just prop's book props that's good.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.550
We're going to get an object.

04:59.550 --> 04:59.910
All right.

04:59.920 --> 05:07.030
We are just canceling the props that we are getting whenever these components render on the screen from

05:07.160 --> 05:07.880
newscast.

05:08.110 --> 05:08.520
OK.

05:08.710 --> 05:09.600
So we get the news.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.280
It's going to be an array of four.

05:11.380 --> 05:14.970
We have all information right here object.

05:15.020 --> 05:15.330
OK.

05:15.370 --> 05:17.380
We have all the news.

05:17.410 --> 05:18.840
So now what we need to do.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.570
We need to grab this props.

05:22.630 --> 05:27.830
We need to loop this array and render everything inside the return.

05:28.050 --> 05:29.110
OK that's fine.

05:29.110 --> 05:30.920
Let's do that on the next section.
