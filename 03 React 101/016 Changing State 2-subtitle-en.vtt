00:00.780 --> 00:03.350
OK so let's see the state in action.

00:03.540 --> 00:10.400
Now whenever we use state we start the component and you declare a state.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.940
You can you can have some options right here some default options.

00:14.100 --> 00:20.550
So what I'm going to do could go right here at the bottom I'm going to say title to something title

00:21.330 --> 00:22.540
An inside the title.

00:22.560 --> 00:26.570
I can have a default value it's going to be the keywords.

00:26.850 --> 00:31.160
For example the keyboards are just done.

00:31.290 --> 00:37.350
And since this is an object are going to come in right here on our application I'm just going to create

00:37.350 --> 00:45.060
two different apps and say DIVX and then are going to say Divx at the bottom to something real simple.

00:45.210 --> 00:52.230
Now since whenever the application loads of react is going to check whatever you have on the state.

00:52.230 --> 00:57.720
So after you have it checks what you have on the state is going to go to the render and it's going to

00:57.720 --> 00:59.190
render the information.

00:59.340 --> 01:05.790
And right here if you make of reference says some values that you have on the states some default values

01:06.050 --> 01:08.290
is going to render this values.

01:08.430 --> 01:14.310
So inside the first div I'm going to do curly braces and I'm going to say OK.

01:14.700 --> 01:15.130
React.

01:15.150 --> 01:20.050
I want you to show whatever I have on the title state.

01:20.130 --> 01:26.100
So I'm going to make reference to this because is this component this class going can say Dot going

01:26.100 --> 01:29.520
to make I'm going to call the state and I want to get the title.

01:29.550 --> 01:35.120
So just like a regular object I'm going to say title and whenever the application loads going to get

01:35.220 --> 01:36.570
I can have the text.

01:36.580 --> 01:38.370
It's going to be the key words are.

01:38.430 --> 01:44.990
So you can have a lot of default values and then you could be changing the state of this Ballis no problem.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.770
So what I want to do right here below the key words are I want to output whatever information we have

01:52.770 --> 01:53.720
in keywords.

01:53.910 --> 02:00.480
So again I'm going to say does Dant state DOT key words.

02:01.500 --> 02:06.050
Now whenever the application loads the key words it's going to be empty of course.

02:06.150 --> 02:07.960
So nothing is going to happen.

02:08.130 --> 02:14.780
But if I go right here and type J is going to show us the state of Quartz.

02:15.060 --> 02:21.050
And again if we just add more information it's going to just display the keyboards.

02:21.060 --> 02:23.510
So what is happening let's go back.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.330
Let me just reload the application.

02:25.560 --> 02:34.410
So the up the component loads is going to wrap the constructor create a state and set some default settings.

02:34.410 --> 02:41.430
So then it's going to go right here and it's going to render the components and it start on the title

02:41.610 --> 02:46.650
it's going to put the default value and keywords is going to be empty because that's what we have in

02:46.650 --> 02:48.060
the state.

02:48.060 --> 02:52.560
Now if I go right here and the user types in F..

02:52.770 --> 02:53.400
OK.

02:53.520 --> 02:59.820
It's going to be type and Neph is going to go to impeach or to onchange is going to trigger the change

03:00.130 --> 03:02.900
and it's going to set a new state for the keywords.

03:03.000 --> 03:03.900
So keywords.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.790
It's not going to be empty anymore.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.680
It's going to have an F..

03:07.960 --> 03:09.650
OK let's get now.

03:09.660 --> 03:16.740
Whenever whenever this is happening re-act knows and it's listening for changes on the state.

03:16.890 --> 03:23.190
So whenever we change the state put whatever value re-act is going to check the state again is going

03:23.190 --> 03:29.100
to go right here again on the render and it's going to render all the information again but that this

03:29.100 --> 03:31.550
state keywords it's not empty anymore.

03:31.590 --> 03:32.620
It's going to have a net.

03:32.850 --> 03:36.220
So it's really rendering everything with the values we have.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.060
OK.

03:37.200 --> 03:45.150
And again if I type anay is going to repeat the exact same process going to go to the to the function

03:45.410 --> 03:47.750
is going to set the state of keywords.

03:47.850 --> 03:53.660
And now it's going to be a it's going to really render everything and this values is going to be tidal

03:53.660 --> 03:59.310
it's going to be the same and this keyboard is going to be FAA and then again just the same process.

03:59.310 --> 04:02.160
Whenever we changes change states.

04:02.280 --> 04:08.280
So this is really important for for react and we're going to use States if we're going to use state

04:08.340 --> 04:09.180
a lot.

04:09.270 --> 04:10.500
Would you react.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.630
OK so let's go to the next section.

04:13.740 --> 04:24.180
And remember what I told you before not to do this state that keyboards for example equal to events

04:24.240 --> 04:27.870
target that value not not to change a state like this.

04:27.870 --> 04:32.430
And again I'm just telling you again because you shouldn't change the state.

04:32.490 --> 04:36.840
And if I do it do not muted state directly use said state.

04:37.050 --> 04:41.070
And you know this is going to work because you're getting a warning.

04:41.070 --> 04:43.480
So this is going to work but you shouldn't use it.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.320
This is some bad idea.

04:45.390 --> 04:46.040
OK.

04:46.410 --> 04:50.610
So again this is enough for state for this part.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.950
Let's go to the next section and talk about something else.
