00:00.390 --> 00:05.640
OK so with re-act we have a particular way to control the assess transitions and we need to make use

00:05.640 --> 00:07.740
of CSSA transfusions group.

00:07.830 --> 00:11.420
This is a separate our own so we need to install it first.

00:11.490 --> 00:12.620
I'm going to show you what to do.

00:12.630 --> 00:13.730
You just need to watch.

00:13.730 --> 00:16.020
There's no need for you to type right now.

00:16.170 --> 00:20.790
And you can have access to all this and get help at the end of the session.

00:20.790 --> 00:21.630
Don't worry.

00:21.820 --> 00:27.480
There is an Ueberlingen of reactor decision but it's not very well documented and there's not much information

00:27.480 --> 00:28.320
available.

00:28.410 --> 00:32.850
So we're going to use the one that everyone is using right now.

00:32.850 --> 00:36.590
So as soon as there is more info available about this new version.

00:36.690 --> 00:38.000
I will just update the.

00:37.990 --> 00:38.910
Don't worry.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.600
So first we need to install the reactor incisions group.

00:42.720 --> 00:47.210
I'm going to go to bew integrated terminal and I installed right here.

00:47.220 --> 00:49.810
I'm just I'm going to install it with you again.

00:52.780 --> 00:53.220
There you go.

00:53.230 --> 00:53.640
OK.

00:53.650 --> 01:06.000
It's going to be NPM install and then begin to do react transmission's transmission and then group right.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.680
You can install a particular version.

01:07.720 --> 01:10.600
It's going to be the one that acts and that we do.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.170
Mine is mine is safe.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.320
And of course it's going to take just a minute.

01:15.430 --> 01:16.160
Right.

01:16.210 --> 01:19.190
So after we after it's install.

01:19.330 --> 01:21.860
Well I've made a project first.

01:21.910 --> 01:27.860
It's a real simple project we have just three different views a basic and a fade and a slide.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.820
So basically what we're doing right here whenever we click an element add an element it's going to add

01:33.910 --> 01:36.590
just new elements with a random number.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.350
You can have all the code right here it's very simple.

01:39.430 --> 01:42.800
So we we we move an element of course is going to remove it.

01:42.820 --> 01:48.320
Now the main point of this is that we are going to be animating this with TSF transitions.

01:48.640 --> 01:58.790
So I'm going to do NPM start because I'm just rendering from Keshet right now can do NPM start now.

01:59.080 --> 02:06.150
The main idea of CSSA rescissions group is that everything is going to be animate it through the process.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.860
It's not a transition at all.

02:08.860 --> 02:15.550
The only thing that Bre-X react to its handling of this with this system sensation's group is going

02:15.550 --> 02:21.050
to be the classis is going to know whenever the element appears or disappears.

02:21.160 --> 02:28.180
So if I add an element re-act is going to handle whenever the is this element appears with classes and

02:28.180 --> 02:29.800
the same thing backwards.

02:30.070 --> 02:38.290
So the first thing to use this is we need to import the package we installed so we can say import and

02:38.290 --> 02:46.050
then begin we begin to use CSSA everything in caps and then transmission's group decision groups.

02:48.060 --> 02:49.860
All right that's fine.

02:50.190 --> 03:00.030
Now we need to is we need to bring it from is going to be re-act dash dash and then transition and then

03:00.030 --> 03:04.830
group right now to use it.

03:04.850 --> 03:06.470
It's it's kind of confusing.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.640
It's actually really confusing.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.200
Just like we did with the.

03:10.350 --> 03:17.810
With all of the other dependencies like the router and everything else we need to wrap everything we

03:17.860 --> 03:21.090
need to wrap the element that we want to animate.

03:21.090 --> 03:28.950
In this case I want to wrap this because whenever an element appears right here we want to animate that

03:28.950 --> 03:29.770
transition.

03:29.850 --> 03:36.660
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to wrap everything inside C Ss transmission's group.

03:36.710 --> 03:38.790
This actually works like this.

03:38.860 --> 03:41.950
So I'm just going to wrap everything right here.

03:42.550 --> 03:43.360
OK.

03:43.980 --> 03:47.020
Now if I just reload the page.

03:47.580 --> 03:50.180
Right now nothing is going to happen.

03:51.130 --> 03:56.230
And of course we're going to get a lot of hers error messages a lot.

03:56.560 --> 04:03.220
So well we get to have failed prompt type the prompt insertion smart as required in the C SSN where

04:03.340 --> 04:05.170
we get a lot more.

04:05.170 --> 04:10.600
The thing is add that to use this to use CSSA transitions group we need to do a lot of setup.

04:10.630 --> 04:15.050
We need to set to put a lot of settings right here inside the stack.

04:15.250 --> 04:19.870
So let's go to the next section and start talking about this this setting's.
