WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:04.030
OK so now we have the translation enter set up.

00:04.170 --> 00:07.550
So whenever we add an element we're getting that transition.

00:07.590 --> 00:10.110
So we want to do the same thing but the opposite.

00:10.110 --> 00:16.910
We win whenever we remove an element we want to get that fading transition with the cars.

00:17.070 --> 00:19.750
Or maybe just do something else right now.

00:19.800 --> 00:24.900
If I inspect this on the console it is giving us a failed prop transmission.

00:24.910 --> 00:27.750
Leave a timeout wasn't supplied.

00:27.960 --> 00:33.630
And this is the giving of this error because we have transition enter but we can have the opposite of

00:33.630 --> 00:36.690
that which is transitional leave are going to go right here.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.910
Just let me bring this down.

00:38.980 --> 00:42.350
I'm going to go right here and see swoosh since we have the transmission enter.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.130
We pretty much do the same thing.

00:44.130 --> 00:50.850
Going to say transition and then instead of enter is going to be the transition of just like we did

00:50.850 --> 00:51.870
with transmission enter.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.980
We need to activate this one.

00:54.060 --> 00:55.280
So it's going to be true.

00:55.590 --> 00:56.320
OK.

00:56.730 --> 01:02.060
Then again just like your incision enter time out we need to do the same thing is going to be transition

01:02.640 --> 01:04.280
Antar time out.

01:04.310 --> 01:06.330
Oh sorry transmission.

01:06.510 --> 01:10.160
Leave him in mistake right here.

01:10.230 --> 01:11.520
Transition.

01:11.540 --> 01:11.970
Leave.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.300
And again just time out.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.230
Well some day.

01:18.530 --> 01:18.960
OK.

01:19.020 --> 01:24.170
Now the transition time out again we use 500 just 500 milliseconds.

01:24.270 --> 01:24.510
OK.

01:24.510 --> 01:30.090
Something simple if I add an element we get transmission if I remove it it's going to do it.

01:30.150 --> 01:31.770
It's going to take 500 seconds.

01:31.770 --> 01:33.530
But there is no animation.

01:33.660 --> 01:40.810
We need to give the as you said this up inside the CSX just like the basic answer.

01:40.920 --> 01:46.290
Whenever we are entering with an element whenever an element an element it's entering on the screen

01:46.610 --> 01:48.200
we just do the same thing.

01:48.210 --> 01:55.730
We have to set the same options whenever an element leaves in a react instead of doing something we'd

01:55.740 --> 01:59.970
enter is going to add a class just a dash and leave.

01:59.970 --> 02:01.080
So I'm going to go right here.

02:01.140 --> 02:04.730
I'm going to say basic dash and leave.

02:04.980 --> 02:05.550
All right.

02:05.580 --> 02:07.230
Just make sense.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.950
Now the background for this going it just change the color.

02:10.030 --> 02:15.110
It's going to be background and it's going to be again the one we are using right here.

02:15.210 --> 02:16.500
It's going to be abstract.

02:16.740 --> 02:20.530
And then just the default color right now.

02:20.670 --> 02:28.740
Again just like before with the basic answer we can have a basic leave and a basic leave active.

02:28.740 --> 02:29.410
Same idea.

02:29.430 --> 02:33.210
It's always the same the same the same motion the same ideas.

02:33.650 --> 02:47.200
OK so I'm going to go and say basic Dorsch leave and then dog that basic Dasch leave and then active.

02:47.520 --> 02:52.270
So right here we want to change the color to this darker blue.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.600
Put it right here.

02:53.880 --> 02:57.350
And then again we want to do the transmission all again.

02:57.450 --> 03:01.050
So you know if you check this code this is pretty much the same.

03:01.080 --> 03:05.320
So it's you always going to end up copying and pasting.

03:05.540 --> 03:06.720
OK that's good.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.820
So I'm going to reload the page again to add an element and we get the precision.

03:11.910 --> 03:14.580
If we move it we get the transition as well.

03:14.610 --> 03:18.660
It's just giving that Connor and doing it all right.

03:18.660 --> 03:24.630
So this is working now I'm going to I'm going to just add some things because you know it's just changing

03:24.630 --> 03:27.680
the color and it's not fun at all.

03:27.690 --> 03:28.510
So when I'm going to do.

03:28.530 --> 03:34.880
I'm going to go to the active and I'm going to add a transform so we can see some translating right

03:34.890 --> 03:35.420
here.

03:35.610 --> 03:41.440
So I'm going to say translate and then just X you can move it on the x axis.

03:41.520 --> 03:50.950
It's going to be minus 100 and it's just 100 percent going to just move it all going to reload the page.

03:51.090 --> 03:52.070
Mr. semicon.

03:52.150 --> 03:53.090
OK that's good.

03:54.380 --> 03:59.160
So again I'm going to add an element works and if I remove it.

03:59.160 --> 03:59.570
Right.

03:59.670 --> 04:01.900
So that's nice.

04:02.110 --> 04:04.840
Go again and Edelman's that works.

04:04.940 --> 04:08.200
If remove it it's going to work just fine.

04:08.570 --> 04:09.500
OK.

04:09.510 --> 04:15.330
So we have one more thing I want to cover right now before we move to the next section and go back to

04:15.330 --> 04:18.260
the basic And OK we have this transition.

04:18.270 --> 04:18.830
Enter.

04:18.900 --> 04:24.760
So it's the options whenever they option whenever an item enters the screen.

04:24.810 --> 04:29.530
We have the transitional leave whenever an item it's leaving the screen.

04:29.700 --> 04:36.490
But the thing is that what happens if I want to animate everything whenever the page loads.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.970
So we have that option and it's going to be called Transition appear.

04:40.980 --> 04:46.950
You have to enter leave and we have a pier going to go right here and are going to say transition and

04:46.950 --> 04:49.310
then appear just like that.

04:49.490 --> 04:53.400
And again we need to set this to true just like we did with the other ones.

04:53.680 --> 04:57.580
And here again we need to set the transmission of pier time out.

04:57.780 --> 05:00.910
So there's going to be transition appear.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.630
And then time out.

05:03.630 --> 05:04.790
Right.

05:05.010 --> 05:07.300
And this is going to be again 500.

05:07.970 --> 05:08.640
OK.

05:08.970 --> 05:11.460
And again same idea with the CSSA.

05:11.490 --> 05:17.040
I'm going to go right here and I'm going to go just on top and we're going to do dot basic.

05:17.220 --> 05:22.940
And the option instead of enter and instead of leave again it's going to be a.

05:23.380 --> 05:24.140
OK.

05:24.420 --> 05:28.130
So I want to give an Apache to everything.

05:28.290 --> 05:35.270
So I'm going to say opacity and it's going to be zero Kumo one something really simple.

05:35.550 --> 05:36.110
Right.

05:36.330 --> 05:40.950
So again we need to set the second state which is going to be the active one.

05:40.950 --> 05:45.310
So I'm going to say Dot basic appear donnish.

05:45.650 --> 05:46.230
Oh sorry.

05:46.230 --> 05:55.950
Basic appear the dot and basic Dot and Dash appear dash active just the same idea and begin to give

05:56.100 --> 06:03.230
an A pass city of one so we can view it on the screen and begin to give a transmission.

06:03.240 --> 06:09.170
So it's going to be transition and that you are going to be using the capacity.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.650
We're going to say capacity.

06:11.010 --> 06:19.910
And then it's going to be docked five seconds or whatever and there's going to be is in them.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.130
All right.

06:21.140 --> 06:25.410
So let me reload the page and you can see that you're getting that effect.

06:26.820 --> 06:34.010
Whenever the elements are appearing on the screen begin to trigger this animation right.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.200
So there was one.

06:35.200 --> 06:35.590
OK.

06:35.770 --> 06:40.430
Let's go to the next section and we're going to do something else with the other transitions.
