WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:03.660
OK so we can make this better.

00:03.670 --> 00:08.800
Now what happens if you have a lot of transitions on the same component or you can have a maybe a lot

00:08.800 --> 00:10.870
of issues in your application.

00:10.990 --> 00:14.920
And you know creating the Virals and pasting the Virals right here.

00:15.220 --> 00:17.860
It's not a damn good idea.

00:17.860 --> 00:22.970
Notice what happens if I want to add this Faid animation to the fade.

00:23.110 --> 00:27.990
Yes but I want I want to use it right here on the basic for example.

00:28.030 --> 00:31.160
You can have to copy and paste everything right here.

00:31.390 --> 00:34.270
So what we can do we can make something different.

00:34.390 --> 00:41.650
We can kind of create a configuration file for example going to go right here on the source or create

00:41.740 --> 00:42.880
a new file.

00:42.880 --> 00:50.430
And this one is going to call animations whatever it's going to be dodginess Burguet.

00:50.650 --> 00:57.700
So inside these animations we're going to just copy this Konst viral and go right here and just paste

00:57.700 --> 00:58.220
it.

00:58.630 --> 01:00.190
All right let's get.

01:00.250 --> 01:07.310
So what we can do right now instead of just having having the information right here what we can do.

01:07.480 --> 01:14.710
We can import that Vrable into this component just like we're doing right here with the with the re-act

01:14.710 --> 01:17.170
opponent and the CSSA rescissions group.

01:17.170 --> 01:24.340
So I'm going to say transition's or whatever and I'm going to say import I'm going to just make use

01:24.340 --> 01:28.490
of destructuring they're going to bring the name of the transmission.

01:28.630 --> 01:32.060
I want to bring it right here on the Faid that jazz.

01:32.380 --> 01:33.980
And it's going to be Faid animation.

01:34.390 --> 01:35.910
And then we're going to do from.

01:36.210 --> 01:40.470
And then again it's going to be dot and it's going to be animations.

01:40.570 --> 01:40.940
Right.

01:40.950 --> 01:41.720
Let's get.

01:42.010 --> 01:47.460
So we have this faint animation configuration available inside of this component.

01:47.650 --> 01:53.170
So if I just reload the page and go to fade at and it's not working it will a check.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.630
Why.

01:54.850 --> 01:56.260
Why it's not working.

01:56.260 --> 01:59.040
If I remove and nothing happens.

01:59.470 --> 02:01.120
It's like not working.

02:01.340 --> 02:06.510
Well the thing is that we've made a file with some information inside.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.230
It could be it could be anything.

02:08.230 --> 02:09.470
In this case it could be anything.

02:09.490 --> 02:16.060
Right here we just have a viable and just like we're doing class extends component right here at the

02:16.060 --> 02:18.730
bottom we we're exporting it.

02:18.820 --> 02:25.180
We are making this class available for other components inside the the same application.

02:25.180 --> 02:26.970
So we need to do the same thing.

02:27.040 --> 02:31.220
So I'm going to go right here and say export.

02:31.420 --> 02:31.930
All right.

02:31.930 --> 02:36.130
So if I ever load the page do the add elements and notice that it's already working.

02:36.280 --> 02:41.540
It's fading in and it's working and we move and it's working as well.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.050
You know this is a better approach.

02:44.500 --> 02:48.530
Instead of using the other one but again it's just up to you.

02:48.860 --> 02:49.120
OK.

02:49.130 --> 02:52.300
We're going to do the slide now just to you to the practice.

02:52.360 --> 02:58.670
I'm going to go to the slide one and we pretty much repeat the same process.

02:58.810 --> 03:01.510
We get a copy right here from from the fade.

03:01.750 --> 03:06.190
The important CSSA rescissions group is right here the bottom.

03:06.190 --> 03:14.130
We need that configuration file for the animations so important and we don't need the fit animations

03:14.140 --> 03:19.090
we can create a new one and this one is going to be called just going to copy and paste of all this

03:19.770 --> 03:24.820
right here at the bottom and we need to change the name for this one instead of Faid is going to be

03:25.230 --> 03:28.670
slide and the names get a fade.

03:28.900 --> 03:33.080
It's going to be light and all the other settings just the same.

03:33.610 --> 03:35.860
So we have our slide animation.

03:36.070 --> 03:40.390
It's being exported I'm going to go to Slide and select that one.

03:40.530 --> 03:43.880
So we're going to bring that venerable into this component.

03:44.130 --> 03:44.710
OK.

03:44.980 --> 03:51.220
So right here at the bottom we need to make use of the physicians group is going to be assessed and

03:51.220 --> 03:52.580
then transmission's

03:55.450 --> 04:06.190
again transitions and open or close in a copy of this just copy paste the name of the physician it's

04:06.190 --> 04:12.790
going to be slight animation and we just repeat the same process done that dot and the name of the bottle

04:13.570 --> 04:15.230
rocket that's going to work.

04:15.310 --> 04:16.100
That's good.

04:16.150 --> 04:17.440
I go to Slide.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.910
Nothing happens because we need to do the CSSA for this first.

04:20.920 --> 04:25.970
So again I'm going to go to OP that says I'm going to do the job.

04:26.010 --> 04:28.600
This is just the setup for the siestas glasses.

04:28.840 --> 04:36.760
First we have the slide appear so again don't slide and appear here.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.020
There you go.

04:38.020 --> 04:42.470
This one is going to have an A passerby of 0 one.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.630
And then we're going to have a transform begin to use the transform.

04:46.780 --> 04:52.300
So whenever the application loads all the elements are going to be kind of up off the screen right here.

04:52.390 --> 05:00.580
So I'm going to use transform and the transform is going to be translated and then just X and inside

05:00.580 --> 05:04.380
here I'm going to do a minus 100.

05:05.060 --> 05:05.380
OK.

05:05.410 --> 05:08.500
Let's get to the same thing for the active state.

05:08.500 --> 05:20.540
It's going to be slide dash appear of slide dash appear then it's going to be don't slide appear and

05:20.540 --> 05:23.730
then dash active after awhile.

05:23.750 --> 05:29.200
This this one this process right here is kind of simple it's just copy and paste.

05:29.210 --> 05:31.100
So this one is going to be a passerby.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.280
It's going to be one.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.460
Do it again.

05:34.670 --> 05:42.110
It's going to be one begin to make up beginning to transform into to transform and begin to set this

05:42.110 --> 05:42.780
one to see.

05:42.790 --> 05:46.890
So one for this element to go back to its original position.

05:46.910 --> 05:49.100
So I'm going to copy all of this.

05:49.910 --> 05:52.960
I'm going to paste it right here instead of minus 100.

05:53.150 --> 05:54.490
It's going to be zero.

05:54.590 --> 05:55.630
It's good.

05:55.730 --> 06:03.050
So the next thing we need to do we need to set up the the transition for the transmission all and the

06:03.530 --> 06:06.760
the amount of time that it's going to take for this transition.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.210
OK.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.900
So it's going to be a transition.

06:10.970 --> 06:14.020
And then it's going to be all going to do OK.

06:14.330 --> 06:20.000
Then dad five six and then it's going to be ease in.

06:20.090 --> 06:20.630
All right.

06:21.170 --> 06:29.030
So if I read the page ok everything it's just sliding and right.

06:29.250 --> 06:37.320
Let's do the same thing for the transition Antar So he's going to be dot slide dash Antar and I'm pretty

06:37.320 --> 06:40.880
sure that you got the idea of what we need to do right now.

06:40.920 --> 06:45.600
It's going to be Pasotti zero one whatever.

06:46.470 --> 06:47.210
OK.

06:47.430 --> 06:50.120
Then the transform is going to be minus 100.

06:50.130 --> 06:51.870
Just going to copy and paste.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.980
And now we need to set up the slide.

06:54.260 --> 06:54.860
Active.

06:54.870 --> 07:04.290
So it's going to be that slide enter Dorsch active and then just give the prompts could to just keep

07:04.320 --> 07:07.620
everything in the same format.

07:07.620 --> 07:11.730
If I do this right here it's still going to work.

07:11.850 --> 07:12.060
So.

07:12.080 --> 07:12.600
OK.

07:13.020 --> 07:15.020
So what do we need to do right now.

07:15.030 --> 07:19.580
We need to set up a passage of one so it can be admissible.

07:19.830 --> 07:25.140
We need to set a decision on just going to copy and paste and in real life you're going to do this as

07:25.140 --> 07:26.020
well.

07:26.100 --> 07:31.130
And now we need to do the tranced to translate everything so we can hide everything.

07:31.650 --> 07:32.080
OK.

07:32.930 --> 07:33.720
Breguet.

07:34.170 --> 07:39.580
So if I just read the page add an element it's going to work just fine.

07:41.270 --> 07:44.920
OK so now we need to set up the leave so.

07:44.970 --> 07:46.430
Same idea.

07:46.850 --> 07:47.760
I'm going to go right here.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.380
The bottom is going to be slide.

07:50.660 --> 07:51.120
Leave

07:54.780 --> 07:55.250
OK.

07:55.510 --> 07:58.720
So this slide leave is going to have an Pasotti of one

08:01.950 --> 08:04.970
one and then you can use translate.

08:04.970 --> 08:08.120
Zero percent zero zero zero percent.

08:08.260 --> 08:09.110
That's good.

08:09.560 --> 08:21.420
Now again that slide is going to be leave and then dot slide leave active.

08:22.260 --> 08:24.190
And this one again real easy.

08:24.230 --> 08:29.170
It's going to be a passerby 0.1 begin to use the transition.

08:29.810 --> 08:35.470
And then we're going to use a translator of mine is 100 percent.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.880
We make this better.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.130
That's good.

08:39.500 --> 08:44.050
So let's Rouleau the page and see if this is working in the abdomen.

08:44.040 --> 08:44.420
All right.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.700
And worse if I remove it.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.590
All right let's get.

08:48.590 --> 08:56.870
So all of this information of this this app I made right here just to show you this is going to be available

08:57.230 --> 09:02.660
on the number for transitions inside to get HAVE going to give you the link so you can download that.

09:02.810 --> 09:09.200
If you don't know how to use get have just let me know and then tell me how to how to download and install

09:09.200 --> 09:14.550
everything for get have if not you can go get have and download a zip file for this.

09:14.890 --> 09:15.870
OK that's fine.

09:15.950 --> 09:20.140
But this is enough for you with the transition section.

09:20.180 --> 09:21.600
Let's go to the next topic.
