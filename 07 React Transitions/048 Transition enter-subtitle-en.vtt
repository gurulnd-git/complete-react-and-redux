WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:01.470
Right.

00:01.470 --> 00:05.650
So the first set up we need to do is going to be the name of the session.

00:05.820 --> 00:09.880
I'm going to use the word basic Just like right here on the route.

00:09.900 --> 00:12.230
We have basic right here so I'm going to use that one.

00:12.270 --> 00:13.370
OK just for a simple.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.280
Just to tell you something simple.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.260
So to give it a name to a success.

00:18.300 --> 00:24.770
Yes as a transitional group we need to use transition and that's the first word we need to use transition.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.290
And then we need to use the name keyboard.

00:27.310 --> 00:29.080
It's going to be transitioning.

00:29.340 --> 00:31.390
And this is going to be equal to a string.

00:31.530 --> 00:34.400
It's just like using an ID or a class.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.960
So since all I want to use basic I'm going to put basic.

00:38.090 --> 00:38.770
All right.

00:39.180 --> 00:46.510
So now what we want to do we want to activate an animation whenever a new element is added on this list.

00:46.530 --> 00:50.630
I'm going to click an add element is going to add an element but we don't want that.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.280
We want to animate that.

00:52.570 --> 00:52.910
OK.

00:52.950 --> 00:58.790
So the first thing we need to do and we need to know actually is that react.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.070
It can work.

01:00.090 --> 01:04.560
Works in steps just like we have the state of the lifecycle.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.740
Well this is the same idea.

01:06.900 --> 01:14.420
The first set up is the name then whenever an item is added on the list our list is going to be transition

01:14.490 --> 01:14.980
enter.

01:15.150 --> 01:17.580
That is the idea we need to use.

01:17.580 --> 01:18.780
So I'm going to go right here.

01:18.990 --> 01:26.230
And for the transition enter we need to do we need to create two settings we need to add two settings.

01:26.250 --> 01:32.040
First one is going to be transition transition transition.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.420
There you go and it's going to be enter.

01:34.650 --> 01:35.810
That's the first keyword.

01:35.820 --> 01:42.510
Whenever an element is entering on the screen we need to do the setup now right here instead of using

01:42.510 --> 01:43.060
strings.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.360
We're going to use curly braces and what we do right here.

01:46.380 --> 01:52.010
We need to tell re-act that we want to use this transition Antar set up.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.230
So instead of Fallston going to say true.

01:54.690 --> 02:00.960
So re-act is going to know that we want to do a transition enter and it's going to activate this feature.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.850
The second thing is that we need to set up is going to be a transition timeout.

02:04.890 --> 02:11.500
So I'm going to say transition and then it's going to be enter again.

02:11.580 --> 02:17.180
So we can make reference to the same ID but this time I'm going to add timeout.

02:18.030 --> 02:18.670
All right.

02:18.870 --> 02:23.340
So the time out we're going to need to wrap everything in Currall basis and the time out.

02:23.340 --> 02:28.730
It's going to be the time that it's going to take react to use this transition answer.

02:28.980 --> 02:29.980
So what we want to do.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.350
I'm going to put just 500 milliseconds just to do something simple.

02:34.530 --> 02:44.670
OK just let me open the right here I'm going to just reload the application and that's fine.

02:44.670 --> 02:48.400
This is an error message but fix it in a few seconds.

02:48.510 --> 02:51.890
I'm going to just open the browser just a little bit wider.

02:52.020 --> 02:57.800
I'm going to go to elements now I'm going to inspect right here just the gentleman's.

02:57.870 --> 02:59.610
And we're going to have just two items.

02:59.720 --> 03:00.890
The one with the 99.

03:00.900 --> 03:04.770
And then the 25 and I'm going to do at ELINT is going to add an element.

03:05.040 --> 03:09.680
And can you see that it's kind of a flashing a class right here.

03:10.710 --> 03:11.120
All right.

03:11.170 --> 03:12.600
That is pretty much it.

03:12.650 --> 03:16.770
Whenever we add an element we act is going to add these div..

03:17.000 --> 03:18.730
And it's going to add a class to it.

03:18.830 --> 03:25.090
And after 500 milliseconds is going to remove the class so we can create animations with classes.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.650
I'm going to put five thousand.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.350
So we can see that that ID right here go right here.

03:32.360 --> 03:38.000
I'm going to click add elements and it's going to give us a class and I get the it's going to be basic

03:38.150 --> 03:42.790
Dorsch Antar basic Dasch enter active again let's do it again.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.080
So this is what we get.

03:45.080 --> 03:51.930
So now with this what we can do we can make we can go to see assess and make make a reference to this.

03:52.310 --> 03:53.570
OK let's let's do that.

03:53.570 --> 03:54.570
Let me just show you.

03:54.590 --> 03:58.160
I know can be confusing but don't worry you're going to get it.

03:58.180 --> 04:04.240
So OK I'm going to go to the C Ss and right here I have just the tax for here the tax for everything.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.460
So I'm going to.

04:05.510 --> 04:12.120
First we need to set up the main the main class OK the of the default class.

04:12.380 --> 04:18.590
So whenever the element entered the screen I went for that for the Alman to be in a kind of a darker

04:18.650 --> 04:19.280
blue.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.060
So OK.

04:20.150 --> 04:23.230
So first we have the class that is going to be basic.

04:23.510 --> 04:25.870
OK that was the name of the transition.

04:26.030 --> 04:32.420
Since we're using an enter transition I'm going to do dash and re-act is going to just add this dash

04:32.480 --> 04:36.130
enter then the other elements check it right here.

04:36.360 --> 04:42.170
Going can have basic dash enter that it's that it's going to be added by react.

04:42.170 --> 04:48.840
So since Is this the basic enter is going to be the main class to first class whenever an element is

04:48.860 --> 04:49.550
entering.

04:49.620 --> 04:56.600
I'm just going to set a default color size can be background and I'm going to add a hash tag.

04:56.660 --> 05:03.780
And then 3 F 5 won b 5 just something like that.

05:03.920 --> 05:08.490
Just like this is going to be just a darker blue.

05:09.070 --> 05:09.360
OK.

05:09.380 --> 05:10.750
Let's reload the application.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.200
Just going to bring this down.

05:12.420 --> 05:16.880
I'm going to add element and it's going to be with the darker blue.

05:17.480 --> 05:21.290
Now after five seconds react is going to remove the class.

05:21.350 --> 05:22.450
Let's do it again.

05:23.900 --> 05:29.570
It's going to take five seconds and it's going to remove the class and this element is going to go back

05:29.570 --> 05:31.400
to the original state.

05:31.400 --> 05:38.840
Now what we want to do we want to react to it too instead of just doing this to animate that transition

05:38.840 --> 05:42.740
between cars since we have the interactive we can use that.

05:42.860 --> 05:48.500
So I'm going to use basic answer right here and we need to set up the animation.

05:48.740 --> 05:55.440
So I'm going to say basic answer Dodd and I to make reference to that basic Antar active we have right

05:55.440 --> 06:01.850
here can have basic Antar active so we can give some styling to that.

06:02.040 --> 06:09.750
I'm going to say basic dosh answer dosh active OK.

06:09.810 --> 06:20.210
And I want to be for the background to be of the same one than before it's going to be 2 1 9 6 EF 3.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.790
That is the same car than this.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.260
It's just the default color.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.300
And since we want to animate everything.

06:26.460 --> 06:31.620
I'm going to say transition and we're going to use CSSA musicians and I'm just going to animate all

06:32.310 --> 06:36.930
I'm going to put 500 milliseconds and I get to say it's in

06:40.010 --> 06:50.090
there we go over the page and this is going to take this transition is going to take 500 milliseconds.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.900
The thing is that right here inside basic We have five thousand.

06:54.900 --> 06:58.750
So we always need to make sure that we have the same time out.

06:58.880 --> 07:04.280
OK so I'm going to do 500 if now you're going to it's going to work but you're going to have some errors.

07:04.890 --> 07:08.860
So I'm going to add elements and again I just mess that up.

07:08.860 --> 07:09.940
Can it remove this.

07:10.060 --> 07:11.280
Let's do it again.

07:11.720 --> 07:12.100
OK.

07:12.150 --> 07:13.650
That's working.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.660
It's giving us.

07:14.670 --> 07:17.190
It's entering with the with the with a different color.

07:17.400 --> 07:24.590
And then just removing the color and doing the transition when it's going back to the original color.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.610
All right let's get.

07:26.610 --> 07:30.780
So we have more options with CSSA transition group.

07:30.780 --> 07:37.950
We have right now we just checked the transmission enter its back whenever an element it's entering

07:37.980 --> 07:38.790
on screen.

07:38.940 --> 07:42.780
We have more for example whenever the an annulment.

07:42.960 --> 07:46.480
It's leaving the component we have that option too.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.910
We're going to do it on the next section.
