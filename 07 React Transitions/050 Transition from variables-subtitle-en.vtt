WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:04.640
Till we have our basic animation and we get into a failed animation.

00:04.650 --> 00:05.880
It's always the same idea.

00:05.880 --> 00:10.830
We get into pretty much the same thing but with the fading element if she's going to fade in and then

00:10.830 --> 00:16.150
fade out if the element goes out the same idea.

00:16.230 --> 00:16.890
Go to fate.

00:16.890 --> 00:23.100
I'm going to go right here into the fade and the problem is that if we are if we go to the component

00:23.100 --> 00:30.300
for example right here in the basic Will this is a lot of code and imagining that you have you can have

00:30.300 --> 00:33.090
a lot of elements with Transition Group.

00:33.090 --> 00:35.940
And while this could get really really messy.

00:35.940 --> 00:40.440
So I'm going to show you a different way a different approach for the same thing.

00:40.590 --> 00:41.990
I'm going to go right here and top.

00:42.030 --> 00:45.380
And first we need to import the transfers.

00:45.420 --> 00:51.380
So I'm going to just copy of this CSSA from the scoop just paste it right here.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.070
Then we need to wrap everything inside the transition's group.

00:55.200 --> 00:55.500
OK.

00:55.530 --> 01:04.680
So I'm going to go right here and wrap that element with the A C Ss transition strip right OPEN CLOSE.

01:04.740 --> 01:10.380
Now the next thing is going to be to add the attributes right here.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.020
And we can do this in a different way.

01:12.060 --> 01:15.450
I'm going to go right here in the top and we're going to create a viable.

01:15.480 --> 01:23.660
It's going to be Konst and this is going to be called Faid animation just something that makes sense.

01:24.030 --> 01:31.350
And this is going to be an object inside of instead of fitting this attributes right here in the transmission's

01:31.350 --> 01:38.160
group what we can do we can make use of this object and feed that element with the object.

01:38.160 --> 01:42.530
So the first thing we need for the to start logistician is going to be the name.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.520
So this one is going to be called Fate.

01:44.710 --> 01:52.260
It's going to go and create transition and then just name the transition name is going to be fate.

01:52.290 --> 01:55.680
And remember the object we don't do this right here.

01:55.890 --> 01:56.940
It's going to be fate.

01:57.210 --> 01:57.760
OK.

01:57.980 --> 01:58.890
Then a coma.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.950
And OK what's the next one.

02:00.990 --> 02:05.200
I want you to do the appear transition.

02:05.280 --> 02:05.780
OK.

02:05.880 --> 02:11.010
So we do transition and then appear right.

02:11.040 --> 02:14.560
This one's going to be an object too and it's going to be true.

02:14.580 --> 02:17.760
All right then we need the transition appear.

02:17.780 --> 02:18.390
Time out.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.320
So I'm going to do a timeout.

02:20.460 --> 02:21.060
OK.

02:21.320 --> 02:29.140
And this one is going to be 500 milliseconds just like before then we need to set the enter transition.

02:29.310 --> 02:35.240
So again it's just going to be transition and then enter this again it's going to be true.

02:35.760 --> 02:36.770
And then a coma.

02:36.810 --> 02:39.230
And we need to set the time out for this one.

02:39.270 --> 02:41.140
So we just do the same thing.

02:41.160 --> 02:45.660
It's going to be time out and there's one again five hundred.

02:45.690 --> 02:48.540
OK the next one is going to be the transitional leave.

02:48.540 --> 02:54.080
So was going to say transition and leave and it's going to be again just true.

02:54.120 --> 03:01.800
And then again same idea with the transition time out of the 500 milliseconds.

03:01.830 --> 03:02.560
That's good.

03:02.880 --> 03:09.560
So now instead of just doing this inside the element when I can I can do I can just copy this viable

03:09.760 --> 03:13.310
going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to do the following.

03:13.320 --> 03:18.710
I'm going to just add curly braces right here and I can paste that name.

03:19.230 --> 03:25.950
And it's not going to work you know because we are pretty much passing the whole object.

03:26.040 --> 03:31.310
So what we need to do we can we can we can make use of destructuring right here.

03:31.770 --> 03:33.870
It's actually not that torturing is going to be at rest.

03:33.870 --> 03:35.690
Operator is something.

03:35.720 --> 03:39.580
It's in some some a little bit of ESX magic.

03:39.780 --> 03:46.920
So I'm going to do dot dot dot and then just save it and that is going to work.

03:46.920 --> 03:54.420
Now Dot dot dot it's kind of a it's entering this is grabbing this object and with a dot dot dot it's

03:54.420 --> 03:59.600
entering to the contents of this one and for each one is creating an attribute.

03:59.820 --> 04:03.470
That's pretty much what's happening in a nutshell.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.090
So this is when it's really really useful.

04:06.090 --> 04:13.840
Now we need to do the set up on the DSS are going to go to the SS and begin to start setting this up.

04:14.070 --> 04:20.730
So the first thing we need to do is to set up the transition appear for this elements for the fading.

04:20.850 --> 04:22.340
So I'm going to say dots.

04:22.950 --> 04:28.080
We use the fade name and it's going to be Faid appear to fade appear.

04:28.080 --> 04:34.220
It's going to be opacity and just Zero Dark One just like we did before.

04:34.560 --> 04:43.830
Then the next stage is going to be Faid dash appear dot and then fade dash appear active.

04:44.660 --> 04:45.270
OK.

04:45.360 --> 04:53.020
This one is going to have an a passive one and the transmission is going to be capacity.

04:53.910 --> 04:58.590
And then just died five seconds is in.

04:58.760 --> 04:59.230
Right.

04:59.290 --> 04:59.660
Good.

05:00.590 --> 05:05.610
OK so let's review the page all right that's working.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.730
So now we need to do the same thing for the for the enter transition.

05:09.830 --> 05:19.090
So again Faid dosh enter and the entering is going to be a city of 0.1 just to have something.

05:19.280 --> 05:26.840
And then again Faid enter and it's going to be added the add the active it's going to be Faid then enter

05:27.170 --> 05:29.260
and then active.

05:29.800 --> 05:35.270
So that one is going to have to pass city of one and we're going to do the translation for this one

05:35.270 --> 05:35.690
as well.

05:35.690 --> 05:42.950
So I'm just going to copy of this and instead of doing five I'm just going to do 500 milliseconds just

05:43.350 --> 05:47.420
it's actually the same thing 0.5 seconds.

05:47.420 --> 05:50.530
So it's the same idea going to just below the page.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.870
And if I add an element right we're getting that.

05:54.080 --> 06:03.200
Let's get so let's do the remove transition and say Faid instead of enter it's going to be leave and

06:03.200 --> 06:08.240
the leave is going to have an impasse city of one just going to copy and paste and then begin to have

06:08.240 --> 06:17.270
the Faid dosh and then leave dot and then fade leave Dasch active.

06:17.580 --> 06:17.850
Right.

06:17.900 --> 06:24.850
Just like before this one is going to have an apache of zero that one and then the transition again

06:24.870 --> 06:28.630
be we just use the same thing just to save time.

06:29.130 --> 06:33.880
OK so if I reload the page I add a moment.

06:33.970 --> 06:34.810
We are getting it.

06:34.920 --> 06:40.980
And if I remove it right that's working just nicely right.

06:40.990 --> 06:44.670
So again just the same idea in a different way.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.510
So let's go to the next section.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.060
And I'm going to show you something else.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.020
And we're going to do the slide transition.
