WEBVTT

00:01.590 --> 00:08.080
OK so now we're going to talk about reducers now inside the source folder just like we did with components.

00:08.230 --> 00:14.460
We to create a folder that it's going to host all the reducers it's going to go right here inside source

00:14.730 --> 00:16.610
and it can create a new folder.

00:16.830 --> 00:20.250
And this is going to be called reducers just like that.

00:20.770 --> 00:29.310
Now we need to create some files and this reducers folder first is going to have an index just an index

00:29.310 --> 00:29.860
file.

00:29.860 --> 00:36.180
So I'm going to go and create an index that G-S and don't worry this is going to make sense in just

00:36.180 --> 00:37.180
a minute.

00:37.260 --> 00:42.750
Now then what we need since since we can either be using movies or movies that we users are going to

00:42.750 --> 00:47.860
create a new file that is going to handle all this movies reducers.

00:47.860 --> 00:51.590
So I'm going to go right here I'm going to say movies reducers.

00:51.810 --> 00:58.210
We just heard just like that and notice that the underscore and reducer is just like a convention.

00:58.230 --> 01:04.700
You can name this whatever you want you know but since this resistor is going to kinda make sense.

01:05.100 --> 01:10.470
So I'm going to go to index back to index and just going to Klaas's OK.

01:10.770 --> 01:17.580
So now if we go right here in our index we can have the provider and the provider is going to be using

01:17.580 --> 01:22.410
the create store with middleware which is created right here at the top.

01:22.410 --> 01:28.320
This function takes an argument and it's going to take a list of all the reducers.

01:28.650 --> 01:35.700
So what we can do we can pass the index we just create it so we can need a common place where all the

01:35.700 --> 01:39.280
reducers are going to be combined into one single element.

01:39.330 --> 01:45.000
So we can pass one argument right here and that's why again we have the index so the index is going

01:45.000 --> 01:49.100
to combine all the reducers and passed to the provider.

01:49.530 --> 01:57.210
So if we go to the right here to the index that we are going to start creating this combination of all

01:57.210 --> 01:58.340
the reducers.

01:58.650 --> 02:04.830
Now what we need to do first we need to import something from redux that is going to be called Combined

02:04.830 --> 02:05.430
reducers.

02:05.460 --> 02:13.100
So I'm going to say import and then just use destructuring and say combine reducers.

02:13.380 --> 02:14.840
Right.

02:15.210 --> 02:25.930
And this is going to be imported from and redux right now 6 You don't need the the current that anyways.

02:26.240 --> 02:26.860
So OK.

02:26.910 --> 02:33.260
So now what we need to do we need to create a viral that is going to host all the reducers.

02:33.360 --> 02:38.390
So we are going to create just conc just marvel and this is going to be called route reducers.

02:38.430 --> 02:41.370
This is going to say rude and then reducer.

02:41.430 --> 02:44.580
And again this is just like a convention.

02:44.580 --> 02:48.600
This route reducer is going to take the combined we do sir.

02:48.660 --> 02:52.160
We import it right here at the bottom and it's going to pass.

02:52.360 --> 02:53.890
We do Sairy that we want to use.

02:53.910 --> 03:00.660
So we're going to say combine reducers and this is going to be a function and it's going to pass an

03:00.750 --> 03:05.110
object with all the reducers it's going to be working with movies.

03:05.130 --> 03:06.780
We're going to say movies.

03:07.160 --> 03:15.810
Let's get tipples that now since we need this for these cons to be available to other components inside

03:15.810 --> 03:22.900
the same application we need to do export default just like we did before and then route.

03:22.980 --> 03:23.750
We do sir.

03:23.940 --> 03:24.430
Okay.

03:24.570 --> 03:29.880
So this code is going to be available inside of all other components.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.220
Okay that's fine.

03:31.440 --> 03:36.490
So let's going to go back to the index and we need to import that file.

03:36.600 --> 03:45.810
So I'm going to say import and begin to bring movies from and the BEGIN to say oh sorry I made a mistake.

03:45.810 --> 03:50.850
Now movies begin at import reducers import reducers.

03:51.940 --> 03:59.480
And again it's going to be from and I'm going to do that for Slash and reducers.

03:59.550 --> 04:04.540
And of course since we have nothing right here it's going to bring the index right here you get.

04:04.590 --> 04:05.910
You get it right here.

04:06.360 --> 04:06.640
OK.

04:06.660 --> 04:12.390
So we have the reducers So we have the list of all the reducers and what we need to do is just read

04:12.390 --> 04:19.680
this and pass it right here as an argument and this is going to use the the store is going to be created

04:19.710 --> 04:22.460
with all the registers right make sense.

04:22.860 --> 04:28.880
So if I just save it and reload the page we should be getting an error.

04:28.930 --> 04:33.840
Movies is not defined and that is good because we didn't have movies reducers.

04:34.020 --> 04:35.170
So I'm going to go right here.

04:35.190 --> 04:41.320
Back to the combined producers and I'm going to import the movies reducer we have right here.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.560
So I'm going to say import movies.

04:44.730 --> 04:51.810
You know we have this same a same name and this movie is going to be imported from and it's going to

04:51.810 --> 04:52.780
be the same folder.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.920
So I'm going to say don't for Slash and then movies.

04:55.920 --> 05:02.410
Reducers So now the movie is reducers Regis or it's going to be level in the combined reducers.

05:02.630 --> 05:02.970
OK.

05:03.000 --> 05:11.760
If I just do a console log we can get again an error is going to say store does not have a valid re

05:11.850 --> 05:12.370
reducer.

05:12.390 --> 05:15.660
Make sure that the argument is passed to combine registers.

05:15.780 --> 05:21.540
This is good because inside movies every users we have a REDUCE-IT run and begin to create it on the

05:21.540 --> 05:22.090
next section.
