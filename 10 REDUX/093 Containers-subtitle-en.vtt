00:00.990 --> 00:07.500
OK so far we've been using the keywords components or views and that is fine but we react redux.

00:07.500 --> 00:13.920
We need to use something else we need to use containers you know containers is just nothing different.

00:14.160 --> 00:19.740
Our container is just a component that it's directly connected to redux state.

00:20.130 --> 00:25.440
So just like here just to give you an example you could have a folder that is going to be called components

00:25.830 --> 00:33.330
where you have a large list of re-act components and some of this components are I didn't just make

00:33.330 --> 00:40.020
some calls to the read ex-state and maybe you could have other components just dump components that

00:40.020 --> 00:42.820
do but pretty much nothing with redux.

00:43.140 --> 00:49.650
So the thing is that readout is going to advise you to store all the components related to the state

00:49.790 --> 00:53.170
read ex-state inside something that calls containers.

00:53.400 --> 01:00.360
So real simple I'm going to go right here and see we have actions and reducers we will have a new folder

01:00.450 --> 01:09.870
that is going to be called containers consist of UPS Lego containers all together and inside this container

01:10.070 --> 01:15.150
I'm going to have something that it's going to be called movers list because we get a movie or movies

01:15.150 --> 01:17.680
list so I going to create a new file.

01:17.730 --> 01:27.830
It's going to be movies that don't list of movies underscore list and then that jazz.

01:28.450 --> 01:28.740
OK.

01:28.780 --> 01:31.670
So I'm going to copy pretty much the whole app.

01:31.740 --> 01:35.780
Going to put it right here and I'm going to go back to app.

01:35.820 --> 01:40.270
You know it's going to delete all this logic because we don't need it.

01:40.380 --> 01:45.360
I'm going to delete the component will mount because again we don't need it.

01:45.630 --> 01:47.730
We don't need the render list.

01:47.730 --> 01:51.110
We need the render going into the demobbed state to process.

01:51.150 --> 01:57.420
I'm just going to export the default app you know just like a simple component.

01:57.420 --> 01:58.350
Now what we need to do.

01:58.350 --> 02:01.980
And of course we're going to get an error message.

02:01.980 --> 02:07.750
We're going to just delete this and right here we're going to make reference to this movie's list.

02:07.830 --> 02:15.440
So I'm going to say your movies list just like that.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.110
There we go.

02:17.220 --> 02:22.030
Now we want to access this movie list to render whatever we have right here.

02:22.050 --> 02:24.760
We need to we need to import that.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.430
So I'm going to say import

02:29.400 --> 02:33.940
import and then it's going to be movies list from.

02:33.980 --> 02:39.900
And again we need to call to access the containers and inside the containers we can have something that

02:39.900 --> 02:42.260
calls movies list and that's good.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.790
You know we all did this.

02:44.850 --> 02:48.690
It's just a component that it's calling a child component.

02:48.760 --> 02:53.540
Now inside this I made a mistake right here inside the movers list.

02:53.550 --> 02:57.650
We just need to change everything so we can use that name.

02:57.690 --> 03:00.950
So it's going to be just movies list.

03:01.440 --> 03:05.770
And instead of just app it's going to be movies list.

03:05.870 --> 03:08.300
Now just something real simple.

03:08.510 --> 03:13.230
Let me just reload the page and OK I can solve actions in users.

03:13.230 --> 03:13.610
OK.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.170
So I change everything one directory up.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.410
I will just need to do this again.

03:18.420 --> 03:21.170
It's going to be dot for Slash.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.810
And then just move this list now.

03:23.870 --> 03:24.340
I'm sorry.

03:24.360 --> 03:27.610
It's going to be dot dot dot slash.

03:27.630 --> 03:28.290
That's right.

03:28.440 --> 03:34.920
And we go to actions and instead actions of course we're just going to import everything.

03:35.980 --> 03:36.880
And there we go.

03:37.780 --> 03:39.230
You know.

03:39.440 --> 03:44.350
You might be asking yourself Is this really necessary.

03:44.650 --> 03:48.160
Well you could take the easy way and just use components.

03:48.320 --> 03:56.420
But really it's advice you to split everything everything up for performance reasons.

03:56.590 --> 03:59.600
So again this is just up to you.

03:59.990 --> 04:00.290
OK.

04:00.340 --> 04:05.650
So now we just know the basics of redux on the next section.

04:05.680 --> 04:13.230
We will start with a clean create re-act app and we're going to do more complex things with redux.

04:13.420 --> 04:17.380
And don't worry we did they react project.

04:17.380 --> 04:22.000
So we will create a reallife react redux project at the end.

04:22.030 --> 04:22.560
OK.

04:22.690 --> 04:24.670
We're going to do a large project.

04:24.730 --> 04:28.930
So let's go to the next section and start with redux intermediate.
