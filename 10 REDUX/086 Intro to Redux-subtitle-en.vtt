00:01.180 --> 00:07.440
OK so we are starting the redux section of the course and it's going to be challenging for sure.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.390
So what is redux.

00:09.400 --> 00:16.890
If we could check the read documentation they say redux is a predictable state container for javascript.

00:17.130 --> 00:18.370
Well you know that's fine.

00:18.430 --> 00:20.710
It's nice but not very clear.

00:20.890 --> 00:23.150
So let me just show you a chart.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.420
Just a simple chart.

00:24.780 --> 00:25.300
OK.

00:25.480 --> 00:32.140
So right here we're going to have a kind of a container with redox data and you can have just a list

00:32.140 --> 00:32.620
of movies.

00:32.620 --> 00:34.040
OK something real simple.

00:34.180 --> 00:35.580
And this is just like an object.

00:35.620 --> 00:36.110
OK.

00:36.250 --> 00:37.710
So we can have this section.

00:38.050 --> 00:43.240
Now whenever the application starts it's going to fetch in the list of movies from whatever you have

00:43.240 --> 00:48.370
the information it's going to make an at work request and bring a list of movies.

00:48.640 --> 00:55.660
Then redox is going to send the information to to react and it's going to say OK this list of movies

00:55.660 --> 00:59.710
component is going to grab this list of movies and then react.

00:59.740 --> 01:06.460
It's going to grab that information that data will do its job and just render a screen with a list of

01:06.460 --> 01:07.620
movies.

01:07.630 --> 01:13.750
Now if I click on one of this movies begin to kind of do the same process again.

01:13.900 --> 01:19.780
It's going to go back it's going fetch the information is going to store it inside the redox data data

01:19.810 --> 01:26.530
of the movie we selected then redux is going to pass it again to react and is going to know that whenever

01:26.530 --> 01:33.580
we have this data we need to show the movie component is child component and that in that that part

01:33.700 --> 01:39.050
react with this component is just going to go do its job again and show the information.

01:39.090 --> 01:40.880
Ok am atomistic was second.

01:40.920 --> 01:41.600
There you go.

01:41.680 --> 01:47.910
He's going to go and render the bew or the component where we just have this information.

01:47.930 --> 01:49.460
So again redux.

01:49.570 --> 01:57.100
It's kind of a state management Laverty and that's why they say that redux is a state manager and a

01:57.100 --> 01:57.800
library.

01:57.910 --> 02:05.650
And if you think about it this Rydex data is kind of a this state of reacted just just just the state

02:05.650 --> 02:12.910
of re-act just adjacent with a lot of information and this Jason it's being consumed by react and then

02:12.910 --> 02:15.270
react does something with that data.

02:15.600 --> 02:22.090
And yeah if you think about it again it's just like a big object where we store data inside and there's

02:22.210 --> 02:26.910
data always we will advise re-act how to behave.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.840
That's the main point of this.

02:28.960 --> 02:34.390
So let's let's go to the next section we're going to start with a clean project.

02:34.460 --> 02:42.160
OK so if you want just do the Create re-act project them sort of the create with the reactive like just

02:42.160 --> 02:43.270
like we did before.
