00:00.480 --> 00:03.470
All right so let's create a valid REDUCE-IT.

00:03.670 --> 00:07.570
So and this is going to be inside movies reducers.

00:07.690 --> 00:08.830
Yes.

00:09.090 --> 00:12.780
This reducer is going to return a new state.

00:12.780 --> 00:19.350
If an action is matched so I'm going to start and this reducer is just going to be a function.

00:19.530 --> 00:25.800
So we need to write a function and export dysfunction so it can be used inside the combined reducers.

00:26.010 --> 00:32.430
So since we want to export the function I'm going to start saying support and default just like that.

00:32.730 --> 00:37.040
And since you wanted the export function I'm going to say function right.

00:37.290 --> 00:42.710
This function is going to have two main arguments going to do this.

00:43.050 --> 00:48.030
And then just open and close the arguments that we can use here.

00:48.180 --> 00:53.340
It's going to be the previous state and then begin to use the action.

00:54.390 --> 01:02.130
So if I go to the chart again whenever we dispatch an action call to an action creator the action creator

01:02.550 --> 01:07.220
goes to the we do series with some information and the information is just going to be an object.

01:07.230 --> 01:09.680
In this case with the type of a payload.

01:09.900 --> 01:18.210
So again if I just bring this down the data that we douceur is going to receive is going to be just

01:18.210 --> 01:22.950
something like that you know or just an object with a movie list and a payload.

01:22.950 --> 01:29.130
Now the action is going to be this is going to be equal to this object but the type and the payload

01:29.280 --> 01:30.250
to something simple.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.750
OK just an object.

01:31.750 --> 01:32.330
OK.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.640
Let's see the action argument.

01:34.690 --> 01:36.870
You can have that inside action.

01:36.870 --> 01:40.580
Now if this is not real I just put it here just to show you something.

01:40.650 --> 01:43.480
Now the other thing the other argument.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.770
It's it's a little bit more confusing.

01:45.780 --> 01:48.930
I'm going to just come this way just for now.

01:49.230 --> 01:53.590
And this state is going to be the previous State of the application.

01:53.940 --> 01:55.980
So let me just show you an example.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.670
Let's say I have a Whenever the application starts.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.590
We have a state that is going to be zero.

02:01.680 --> 02:02.000
OK.

02:02.010 --> 02:06.070
Just the application loads and starts at zero.

02:06.360 --> 02:12.600
So something happens on the application we make a click we call to an action creator the action creator

02:12.870 --> 02:21.390
returns a type and a payload and we to enter right here now whenever we triggered this function is going

02:21.390 --> 02:25.560
to look for this action is going to match it and it's going to do something.

02:25.840 --> 02:26.210
OK.

02:26.220 --> 02:28.260
It's going to update the state.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.540
Now the state right now it's zero.

02:30.570 --> 02:36.360
So when whenever this reducer is going to update the state the state it's going to be something else.

02:36.360 --> 02:42.200
It's going to be returned for example state now state it's equal to one.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.110
OK it's going to add one.

02:44.410 --> 02:44.860
OK.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.480
So this state now it's going to be equal to one but maybe or maybe later on the application we're going

02:51.480 --> 02:55.360
to do pretty much the same action and begin to trigger this again.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.080
But now the state it's not going to be zero anymore it is going to be one.

02:59.100 --> 03:02.700
So he's going to go right here execute whatever action we have.

03:02.700 --> 03:06.630
And now the state is going to be too you know this is the previous state.

03:06.660 --> 03:08.190
It's always the previous state.

03:08.190 --> 03:10.280
That's why we are using it right here.

03:10.530 --> 03:16.360
Now since whenever the application starts the state it's going to be empty.

03:16.650 --> 03:17.270
OK.

03:17.470 --> 03:22.560
We don't have any data when the application starts then it's going to do something called the reducers

03:22.560 --> 03:23.760
and the actress and whatever.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.780
And it's going to be it's the state.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.970
And you can have some information but when the when the application starts nothing is going to happen

03:29.970 --> 03:32.040
to this state it's going to be just empty.

03:32.040 --> 03:35.390
Now the thing is that if I leave it empty we leave this empty.

03:35.610 --> 03:40.790
We're going to get an error because it's going to say that the state it's not the fine.

03:40.860 --> 03:42.770
So to make it fine.

03:42.810 --> 03:49.020
Well we can say we're going to use something that it's from iOS 6 it's going to be called default function

03:49.050 --> 03:54.350
arguments and whatever whenever we pass an argument inside of a function.

03:54.630 --> 04:01.660
If this state has no data what we can do we can set a default state for this a default value for this

04:01.660 --> 04:08.790
estate so we can say no whenever the application starts state it's not empty anymore it's just going

04:08.790 --> 04:09.640
to be Noul.

04:09.870 --> 04:10.290
OK.

04:10.290 --> 04:11.760
And we're not going to get there.

04:11.790 --> 04:14.280
Now we'll get an error for it for a different reason.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.130
But don't worry.

04:15.510 --> 04:16.180
OK.

04:16.500 --> 04:23.100
Now whenever the we call the action the actual creator the action creator is going to return this object

04:23.520 --> 04:25.250
with a type and a payload.

04:25.260 --> 04:30.300
Now it's going to enter right here to this function and right here what its going to do is going to

04:30.300 --> 04:31.780
search for an action.

04:31.800 --> 04:37.380
We could have a lot of factions right here in this case this one is going to be called movers list.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.120
OK.

04:38.250 --> 04:43.380
But we can have a different reduce or a different action that is going to be called there are no movies

04:43.410 --> 04:46.770
actors or movies tax or whatever.

04:46.800 --> 04:53.430
So what we need to do we need to create a switch that is going to match the type so I'm going to do

04:53.430 --> 04:53.740
that.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.830
And in a minute it's going to make sense.

04:55.830 --> 04:57.580
No we're going to go right here.

04:57.630 --> 05:03.220
I'm going to say switch and is this is regular search with javascript.

05:03.660 --> 05:09.750
We started to switch and what we want to search want to match is going to be the action type.

05:09.840 --> 05:10.510
OK.

05:10.710 --> 05:17.550
So I'm going to say Action action tied up that time.

05:19.110 --> 05:25.170
Now we need to make different cases for this since we are matching the action type are going to say

05:25.260 --> 05:32.560
OK if the case is that the type it has movies the movies list we want to do something.

05:32.580 --> 05:41.560
So I'm going to say movies list now this whenever there is a match is going to return something.

05:41.670 --> 05:48.270
In this case what we return is going to be whenever we have inside the payload you know we have the

05:48.280 --> 05:51.230
type and the payload right here we match the type.

05:51.240 --> 05:56.370
This is going to go through and right here we return the payload to redux.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.540
If you notice this is just a database just adjacent data.

05:59.780 --> 06:00.300
OK.

06:00.690 --> 06:05.420
So we're here I'm going to say return it and I'm sorry.

06:05.850 --> 06:12.280
So we're going to return and what we turn is going to be the action that payload.

06:12.970 --> 06:13.700
Right.

06:13.950 --> 06:15.080
That's what we do.

06:15.540 --> 06:19.300
And if we can't do this we do sir.

06:19.650 --> 06:21.710
And within the time.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.860
And there is no match for the type.

06:23.970 --> 06:31.410
We need to look to return something else so what we do is we set a default case and what we return is

06:31.410 --> 06:33.050
going to be state.

06:33.340 --> 06:36.310
All right the same state we have with the well in the on the application.

06:36.480 --> 06:42.130
So I'm going to say return state right.

06:42.540 --> 06:43.180
That's it.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.580
That's pretty much it.

06:45.150 --> 06:48.040
So again let's go over the process again.

06:48.520 --> 06:52.390
I know that the application loads and notice that we not getting an error right now.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.030
The application loads.

06:54.180 --> 07:00.390
We have a movie Click on the movie is going to call the action creator and the action creator is going

07:00.390 --> 07:07.730
to fetch the information and it's going to pass an object to the reducers with the type and a payload.

07:07.900 --> 07:14.040
This this reducers dysfunction is going to catch whatever we have right here is going to pass a default

07:14.040 --> 07:17.160
state and an action right here.

07:17.190 --> 07:20.980
We search and trying to find a match for this action.

07:21.210 --> 07:25.680
This object the type it's going to be movies list.

07:25.710 --> 07:32.670
So right here we have a match is entering this case and what we return to redux is going to be the action

07:32.730 --> 07:38.510
that payload the information about that movie and then it's going to go to the combined reducers the

07:38.510 --> 07:43.980
combined reducers is going to talk to the index that has and is going to pass it to the Create story

07:44.280 --> 07:45.260
and create the story.

07:45.300 --> 07:52.770
We'll update the the state the read ex-state and then the application read renders that is pretty much

07:52.770 --> 07:53.970
the process.

07:54.870 --> 07:56.390
OK that's fine.

07:56.540 --> 07:57.850
And don't worry I know this.

07:57.880 --> 08:04.730
This is really confusing but to do this a lot of times we can ride a lot of reducers.

08:04.970 --> 08:09.010
So if you don't get it now don't worry you're going to have a lot of practice.

08:09.260 --> 08:13.530
Let's go to the next section and create a natural Creator for this.
