WEBVTT

00:01.260 --> 00:07.680
OK so now what we need to do we need to connect the action creators and the producers and what we do

00:07.680 --> 00:11.220
we connect them through the components.

00:11.580 --> 00:17.840
So I'm going to be inside the app that has the one that it's just outputting rendering the hello world.

00:18.010 --> 00:18.370
OK.

00:18.420 --> 00:21.900
So the first thing we need to do to connect them.

00:21.900 --> 00:28.470
It's going to be it's going to be to bring we can bring something and we're going to bring it from react

00:28.590 --> 00:29.980
react with.

00:30.150 --> 00:32.540
And this is going to be called connect.

00:32.630 --> 00:32.990
Yeah.

00:33.030 --> 00:34.640
You know can it make sense.

00:34.650 --> 00:36.680
It's going to be connect.

00:36.720 --> 00:36.990
All right.

00:36.990 --> 00:43.980
This connect is going to be from and just react redux right.

00:43.990 --> 00:45.190
That's very good.

00:45.630 --> 00:50.950
So the second thing that we need to do is we need to call to an action creator.

00:51.120 --> 00:55.620
So we need to import this action creators so we can use it.

00:55.680 --> 01:01.210
I'm going to I'm going to do it on a different way just to show you how this how this works.

01:01.320 --> 01:06.100
But then we are going to change it but we can call the action creator in a different way.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.630
I'm going to just do this because it's going to be kind of confusing.

01:09.630 --> 01:13.310
So I'm going to just dedicate a whole section to do this.

01:13.560 --> 01:13.860
OK.

01:13.890 --> 01:17.810
So first I'm going to import the action creator and what I'm going to do.

01:17.820 --> 01:25.520
I'm going import all these actions from and then just going to bring the actions.

01:25.680 --> 01:31.560
So this pretty much is going to go to the actual file we have right here and it's going to bring whatever

01:31.590 --> 01:34.490
we have inside there so we we can have access.

01:34.590 --> 01:34.830
All right.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.490
That's why we use this.

01:36.820 --> 01:37.310
OK.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.820
That's the second thing.

01:38.820 --> 01:45.880
Just bringing the actions now what we need to do whenever this component it's loaded on the screen.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.150
We want to call this action and this action is going to go to the producer.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.410
The producer is going to update the state.

01:52.590 --> 01:57.260
And then we need to catch that new state so we can render the information right here.

01:57.490 --> 02:04.020
OK but first I need to call this action creator since we want to Connard whenever the application starts

02:04.410 --> 02:07.570
or the component the components renders.

02:07.590 --> 02:12.750
So we're going to call the component will mount.

02:13.310 --> 02:13.990
OK.

02:14.190 --> 02:20.310
So after this component it's it's rendered we're going to just trigger that function that action creator

02:20.310 --> 02:21.150
from here.

02:21.480 --> 02:26.780
So I'm going to say this that prompts and we're going to call this function.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.980
And I believe it's going to be movies list.

02:29.060 --> 02:30.410
Yeah.

02:31.540 --> 02:31.950
OK.

02:32.040 --> 02:32.670
That's good.

02:32.670 --> 02:33.620
They don't need that.

02:34.140 --> 02:39.660
So again the complaint mounts and we call the movers list the action creator.

02:40.140 --> 02:40.680
OK.

02:40.740 --> 02:47.910
Now this is going to be kind of confusing in react if you remember from a component we can access the

02:47.910 --> 02:51.730
parent state doing this that prompts.

02:51.950 --> 02:56.610
So whenever we call this that prompts we go to the parent component which in this case is going to be

02:56.610 --> 03:02.860
this one and we're going to bring all the set ups and all the data that it's inside prompts.

03:02.940 --> 03:09.900
Well the thing is that if we do now we're used to this that prompts there is no recollection of the

03:09.960 --> 03:10.370
data.

03:10.380 --> 03:13.650
We have the state because the state of react.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.640
It's not the same state as the the redux state.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.250
There are just two different things.

03:19.260 --> 03:23.970
The state is one thing and the reactive state are a different thing.

03:23.970 --> 03:30.660
The thing is that to use them they read Acts state with this that prompts when it's we need a way to

03:30.750 --> 03:37.920
inject the redux state in somebody that this prompts so we can access the data.

03:38.220 --> 03:41.760
So we have a function that it's provided by redux.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.160
And it's going to be it's going to be called Map state to prompts you know the name.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.300
It's kind of confusing but it makes sense.

03:49.300 --> 03:56.680
It's map because we we used make use of the helper map just mapping and the state to.

03:56.700 --> 04:01.140
You're converting the read Act state to prom's makes sense.

04:01.140 --> 04:07.530
So I'm going to go right here before the export and I going to say function is just a function and the

04:07.530 --> 04:16.200
function call map and everything it's in camel case state to prop's you know it's a good age since you

04:16.200 --> 04:17.070
can use it.

04:17.070 --> 04:21.070
A lot of times is a good idea to create a snippet for this.

04:21.450 --> 04:24.130
Just typing everything so you can see Seamew typing.

04:24.380 --> 04:24.910
OK.

04:25.200 --> 04:33.600
So this maps state prompts is going to take one argument and the argument is going to be the state.

04:33.650 --> 04:38.980
Now this map state prompts it's only going to return some some data.

04:39.020 --> 04:40.630
So we're going to say return.

04:40.820 --> 04:41.450
All right.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.460
And this is going to return an object.

04:44.630 --> 04:45.550
Right.

04:45.650 --> 04:51.010
So the object is going to be whatever we want to have available as props.

04:51.140 --> 04:58.430
Since I want to get movies I'm just going to call it movies and the movies is going to be the data that

04:58.460 --> 05:01.160
we want to fetch that one to have.

05:01.160 --> 05:08.320
Sorry it's going to be inside the redux state and this is the read us redux state not the state.

05:08.420 --> 05:15.450
Whenever we just returned the movies everything if we go to the league I have a right here the index

05:15.900 --> 05:16.500
everything.

05:16.570 --> 05:21.220
It's going to be stored inside something that calls movies.

05:21.220 --> 05:26.840
And OK so if I go to the app I have the movies right here and I want to make reference to this that

05:26.850 --> 05:36.100
props the movies and I should be getting whatever I have inside this state of redux darts movies.

05:37.970 --> 05:46.830
OK so in this way we grab whatever we have India read ex-state that costs movies and we can access through

05:46.860 --> 05:50.200
this that prompts movies with this.

05:50.420 --> 05:51.800
That's the first step.

05:51.930 --> 05:57.360
And I'm going to I'm going to go right here and I'm going to say console log and then just state right

05:57.360 --> 06:00.590
so we can see whatever we are getting as a state.

06:00.690 --> 06:03.110
Now we are still getting an error.

06:03.210 --> 06:05.700
So we need to do more things.

06:06.060 --> 06:12.430
So this map state to prop's needs something else to connect redux.

06:12.450 --> 06:13.700
So what we need to do.

06:13.750 --> 06:17.250
We're not going to be exporting default the app.

06:17.340 --> 06:21.070
We need to export that default something from redux.

06:21.330 --> 06:25.480
And since we imported a connect right here we can make use of connect.

06:25.500 --> 06:33.150
So I'm going to go read here just delete the app and I'm going to do connect this connect takes two

06:33.210 --> 06:34.470
arguments.

06:34.650 --> 06:42.420
I can get two arguments and after that everything is ready is going to just return the class which in

06:42.420 --> 06:45.680
this case is going to be app the app component.

06:46.150 --> 06:46.520
OK.

06:46.570 --> 06:49.550
Let's get we are on the good track now.

06:49.560 --> 06:54.070
This this connect is going to take two arguments.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.890
One is going to be the map state two.

06:56.940 --> 07:03.420
That's the first one and then it's going to receive a second argument argument and it's going to be

07:03.570 --> 07:04.910
the actions number.

07:04.950 --> 07:07.290
In this case we imported all the actions.

07:07.410 --> 07:10.160
So it's going to use the actions.

07:10.200 --> 07:10.870
All right.

07:11.190 --> 07:11.850
So OK.

07:11.970 --> 07:17.940
In a natural what we are doing the Kinect is going to make actions available it's going to make all

07:17.940 --> 07:19.410
the function we have right here.

07:19.410 --> 07:26.850
This move is list available so we can use it as this process moves just it is going to call to the action

07:26.850 --> 07:27.580
creators.

07:27.780 --> 07:34.800
And after the state the relaxed state it's updating its It's updated it's going to it's going to use

07:34.800 --> 07:39.200
the map state to prompts and it's going to be everything available inside this process.

07:39.240 --> 07:42.410
That's the main idea of this.

07:42.780 --> 07:47.490
So if you notice right here on the console we are getting something.

07:47.490 --> 07:50.840
The first one whenever the application loads this code.

07:50.880 --> 07:51.870
It's not running.

07:51.870 --> 07:56.640
So whenever we cancel log the main state of redux is going to be null.

07:56.700 --> 08:04.290
If you remember whenever we created the redux I'm sorry the reducers domain reader sir we said that

08:04.290 --> 08:05.660
the state was null.

08:05.670 --> 08:09.030
So that's why we are getting no because there is no data.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.040
But after the component it's loaded.

08:12.290 --> 08:12.670
OK.

08:12.690 --> 08:17.680
The complaint will mount everything to render its mount it is going to go again.

08:17.880 --> 08:24.240
And it is going to call the movers list the movers list is going to go to the to the actual creator

08:24.330 --> 08:25.710
the moves list.

08:25.710 --> 08:31.340
This action creators going to send all this data we have right here to the producer and then we do sir

08:31.350 --> 08:34.940
will update the state with whatever payload we have.

08:35.340 --> 08:40.490
Then it's going to go to redoes read access state and right here the map step prompts.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.810
It's just catching this state this new state right here.

08:43.980 --> 08:47.050
So now we have access to all the movies.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.960
Now it's works in a magic way.

08:49.960 --> 08:54.200
There's there's kind of a magic behind redux.

08:54.240 --> 09:01.980
So now what we can do inside here inside the render we can create a function to just output this all

09:01.980 --> 09:03.110
this information.

09:03.140 --> 09:03.680
OK.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.200
So I'm going to do that now.

09:05.300 --> 09:12.410
Now I was going to wait until the next section but why not why not doing it right now.

09:12.480 --> 09:18.310
So I'm just going to delete this the hello world because we don't need it.

09:18.360 --> 09:25.350
And what I'm going to do I'm going to just I'm going to put everything inside the div you know and I'm

09:25.350 --> 09:31.090
going to call right now to a function that is going to iterate this array.

09:31.230 --> 09:31.760
OK.

09:31.950 --> 09:33.080
Just like we did before.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.260
It's going to say this.

09:34.440 --> 09:38.560
And my function is going to be called render list.

09:38.880 --> 09:44.950
And now the render list is going to take whatever we have inside the map states prompts.

09:45.030 --> 09:52.380
In this case we have movies and the main idea of my state prompts is to make this movies available inside

09:52.380 --> 09:58.660
props so we can do this that prompts dance movies.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.120
All right that's good.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.610
I mean you're getting errors but don't worry we're going to fix right now.

10:03.930 --> 10:06.210
So I'm going to create this function.

10:06.270 --> 10:08.000
It's going to be called render list.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.920
So going to go right here and create a render list function.

10:11.940 --> 10:16.640
This is going to be a fat arrow function right.

10:16.960 --> 10:22.600
And this fat arrow function is going to it's going to take us an argument the list of movies.

10:22.660 --> 10:25.890
So I'm going to go right here and say movies.

10:26.780 --> 10:27.280
OK.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.510
That is good.

10:28.510 --> 10:30.610
Now I'm going to do it and we're going to get an error.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.770
And in a minute I'm going to tell you why.

10:32.830 --> 10:36.150
Because if I do I find just do it.

10:36.150 --> 10:36.850
You're not going.

10:36.880 --> 10:40.920
You're not going to understand why I'm doing a conditional.

10:40.960 --> 10:47.370
I'm going to say return and are going to say I'm going to call the movies object we have right here.

10:47.850 --> 10:48.500
OK.

10:48.760 --> 10:53.160
So we're going to map over it going to say map right here.

10:53.160 --> 11:00.070
We open and close and we do a fad our function just to function OK.

11:00.130 --> 11:04.650
I pass I know I'm going to use movies so it can make sense.

11:04.720 --> 11:13.900
So we're going to return something on each iteration and it's going to be just a div with the name of

11:13.900 --> 11:14.400
the movie.

11:14.410 --> 11:22.240
So I'm going to call a movie that name OK and this is the it's going to be the earth that we're getting.

11:22.260 --> 11:25.390
You're going to get cannot read properly map.

11:25.490 --> 11:26.220
No.

11:26.510 --> 11:27.880
And this is good.

11:28.040 --> 11:35.510
You know whenever with the application LOTES the state of this of this application the main state with

11:35.510 --> 11:37.710
the movies is going to be no.

11:37.940 --> 11:44.720
The thing is that with map we can not loop inside of something we can loop an object that is going to

11:44.720 --> 11:45.420
be null.

11:45.470 --> 11:46.450
You know cannot be done.

11:46.450 --> 11:48.510
It's going to just give you an error message.

11:48.530 --> 11:55.940
So what we need to do we need to use a conditional to check if this movie is empty or not and if it's

11:55.940 --> 12:00.410
not empty we want to do this if not of course nothing is going to happen.

12:00.410 --> 12:06.170
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to say if and then movies.

12:06.620 --> 12:09.640
I'm just going to wrap everything inside here

12:13.460 --> 12:14.320
and we get it.

12:14.420 --> 12:18.660
Pulp Fiction Pacific Rim and Rambo right.

12:18.710 --> 12:22.600
So this is working just fine.

12:22.730 --> 12:27.830
Let's go again through the hold the whole process.

12:27.890 --> 12:32.850
We have the producers and the creators we imported connect from reac redux.

12:32.870 --> 12:39.210
So we can make a connection between this component between the action creators and then the users.

12:39.290 --> 12:47.230
We imported the actions so we can use them then we can skip to the bottom and we make this.

12:47.420 --> 12:52.210
This is this class this component available to redux.

12:52.400 --> 13:00.830
And we are using maps state to props to inject the props the the new state inside props so we can access

13:01.220 --> 13:08.240
the prompts just like this does that prompts and we are using the actions we've imported so we can call

13:08.240 --> 13:10.160
them whenever they're ready.

13:10.580 --> 13:17.150
And then this just fetching the information is making the new state available inside this the props.

13:17.270 --> 13:23.060
And we are calling everything inside this that props that movies so we can get the information so we

13:23.060 --> 13:30.480
can loop it and we get the information you know it's a lot of work just to get three things.

13:30.830 --> 13:36.160
Ted remarriages just like it's all before once you know how to do this you pretty much you can have

13:36.200 --> 13:38.160
just a template to do all of this.

13:38.330 --> 13:43.700
And the only thing that you will need to do is just to assign a name brand here and then just to the

13:43.700 --> 13:44.960
function you know.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.950
OK let's go to the next section.

13:47.090 --> 13:51.430
I want to talk about something else I want to talk about containers.
