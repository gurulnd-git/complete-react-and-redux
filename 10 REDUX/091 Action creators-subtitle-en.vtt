WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:02.130
Right.

00:02.120 --> 00:08.760
So the one in charge to connect with the producer is going to be the action creator just like we did

00:08.760 --> 00:15.060
with the reducer folder which will create a new folder that it's going to host the actions.

00:15.060 --> 00:21.870
So I'm going to go to the source folder and I'm going to create a new folder that calls actions just

00:21.870 --> 00:23.500
like that actions.

00:23.760 --> 00:29.480
Now just again just like we geezer's this actions is going to have an index so I'm going to say index

00:29.720 --> 00:30.090
that.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.650
Yes that's good.

00:32.940 --> 00:35.040
So this is going to be really really simple.

00:35.070 --> 00:38.220
You know there's not a lot of logic right here.

00:38.220 --> 00:44.430
So whenever we call the action we call to a function is just just a function and this function is going

00:44.430 --> 00:46.130
to return an object.

00:46.140 --> 00:52.830
So since we want to call to a function I'm going to just create a function and exported to make it available

00:52.890 --> 00:54.300
on different components.

00:54.330 --> 00:57.690
So I'm going to say export function.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.750
This function is going to have a name.

00:59.760 --> 01:04.860
So whenever we call this action creator we need to call it by its name.

01:04.860 --> 01:11.440
So in this case since we want to get a movies list I'm going to call it movies list.

01:11.940 --> 01:12.270
Right.

01:12.350 --> 01:14.540
And it just closes.

01:14.550 --> 01:16.820
Now this movie's list is going to be a function.

01:16.890 --> 01:21.960
So we use the parenthesis and then the curly braces we open and close.

01:21.960 --> 01:26.610
Now this movie's list which is the action creator is going to return an object.

01:26.610 --> 01:28.420
So we say return.

01:28.550 --> 01:32.310
And then inside here we just return an object.

01:32.850 --> 01:38.160
Now inside the action creator is going to have to things he's going to return an object with two things

01:38.580 --> 01:40.600
a type and a payload.

01:40.770 --> 01:46.920
So the type you need to put a name to the type and this case this reducer is going to receive a type

01:46.920 --> 01:48.350
that is going to be moves list.

01:48.420 --> 01:51.660
So I'm going to use movies list.

01:51.720 --> 01:57.540
The second thing that is going to be passing is going to be a payload and again payload.

01:57.540 --> 01:59.040
It's kind of a convention.

01:59.070 --> 02:06.150
So if you use payload everyone will understand that you could just use whatever you know I'm going to

02:06.150 --> 02:08.850
use payload right.

02:08.970 --> 02:13.490
So this payload pretty much is going to be the data that you're getting from the server.

02:13.710 --> 02:20.670
Maybe before they return you're going to do some some maybe of travel there is going to do a fetch for

02:20.670 --> 02:25.840
example and whatever is going to do the fashion and get the information.

02:25.980 --> 02:30.630
And then when the information is ready and the promise is sold and begin to begin to talk about promises

02:31.530 --> 02:34.950
it's going to return this with the information that we're fetching.

02:34.950 --> 02:39.500
You know we're not going to do that right now just to have something simple.

02:39.540 --> 02:42.550
So this payload is going to be just a list of movies.

02:42.690 --> 02:45.830
I have a list right here which just copy and paste.

02:46.010 --> 02:46.470
OK.

02:46.710 --> 02:51.320
So we return an array of objects with just three movies.

02:51.330 --> 02:52.020
Pulp Fiction.

02:52.020 --> 02:52.760
Pacific Rim.

02:52.760 --> 02:53.860
I love Pacific Rim.

02:53.860 --> 02:56.170
I know it's only but it can a lot.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.210
And then Rambo again just a great movie.

02:59.220 --> 02:59.720
OK.

02:59.880 --> 03:06.830
So this actually creator whenever we call it it's going to go to the reducers and pass this object.

03:06.840 --> 03:13.170
This object is going to be received by all that we do TSRs and the reducers will just try to search

03:13.220 --> 03:22.050
a match up A-type right here since we have the same type again movies list and rike movies list.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.440
There's going to be a match.

03:23.670 --> 03:29.330
And what it's going to return it's the actual payload that we're passing right here.

03:29.500 --> 03:29.830
OK.

03:29.850 --> 03:35.430
Just a list of movies and there is going to grab this payload is going to go to the combined reducers

03:35.780 --> 03:40.970
the combine reducers to the index and it's going to just set a new estate.

03:41.250 --> 03:41.850
All right.

03:41.850 --> 03:46.140
Really simple but we have one problem right now.

03:46.140 --> 03:48.920
We have our action creator and the reducer.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.460
But if you notice there's no mention of this moves to this function.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.470
So we are not connecting them.

03:55.470 --> 04:01.970
So how do we connect the action creators with the reducers.

04:02.170 --> 04:06.800
Again not that simple and we don't do it from here.

04:07.020 --> 04:08.540
What are we willing to do.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.840
We will need to call to this function.

04:11.150 --> 04:11.450
All right.

04:11.460 --> 04:15.730
We call this function inside the components whatever component we have.

04:15.730 --> 04:22.110
If we we want to use it on index to whenever the application loads we need to fetch that information

04:22.110 --> 04:23.600
that moves list.

04:23.610 --> 04:28.930
We go here and we call this auction creator which is called to this function right here.

04:29.190 --> 04:33.280
And this function is going to get triggered and do all its logic.

04:33.450 --> 04:37.260
The thing is that we cannot just call it like this.

04:37.260 --> 04:39.080
We need to do something else.

04:39.090 --> 04:45.750
We need to do a lot of setup first so we can assure that we can make sure that it's going to go to all

04:45.750 --> 04:46.800
reducers.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.760
Let's go to the next section and start just grabbing.

04:50.760 --> 04:56.010
I'm going to grab the app component and make the call to this action creator.
