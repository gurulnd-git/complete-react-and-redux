00:00.820 --> 00:07.870
OK so you might be thinking redux every act are just new technologies so updating the redux state or

00:07.870 --> 00:14.440
just making a network request should be really really simple but really there is a lot of logic and

00:14.440 --> 00:16.340
set up we need to do first.

00:16.660 --> 00:24.910
So to use redux probably we need to use something that calls action creators and producers this action

00:24.910 --> 00:28.840
creator is getting is going to be the one that it's going to be called.

00:28.930 --> 00:35.050
At first this action creator is going to do something and it's going to return an object with a type

00:35.260 --> 00:36.520
and a payload.

00:36.670 --> 00:42.910
So this object is going to go to all the reducers and it's going to search for a reduce or we manually

00:42.910 --> 00:50.290
create for this action and then it's going to go and just update the read ex-state and once the state

00:50.320 --> 00:57.060
it's updated re-act is going to render with just new information on a really really confusing.

00:57.160 --> 01:01.040
Let me just show you a chart I have right here.

01:01.070 --> 01:04.650
It's going to hide everything else so we can start from the beginning.

01:04.710 --> 01:07.770
So we're going to have just an application we just for movies.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.280
OK.

01:08.310 --> 01:15.510
And if we click on one of these movies we just need to fetch some data and show the detailed information

01:15.510 --> 01:16.420
of this movie.

01:16.650 --> 01:23.220
So whenever we click what are we going to do we're going to call to an action creator this action creator

01:23.500 --> 01:25.770
is going to return just an object.

01:25.770 --> 01:31.270
The object is going to have two things one the type and the type is just a name.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.480
OK in this case we're just we want to get a movie.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.040
It's just a movie.

01:36.150 --> 01:40.890
And the second thing is going to it's going to have it's going to be a payload this payload is going

01:40.890 --> 01:43.640
to be the information that comes from the server.

01:43.650 --> 01:49.410
For example if you click it is going to go to the to make a network a network request and bring some

01:49.440 --> 01:50.460
Jason data.

01:50.580 --> 01:56.210
You know the detailed information about the the element we just clicked.

01:56.370 --> 02:02.340
So after it's just getting this the type and the information we have in the on the payload it's just

02:02.340 --> 02:08.630
going to go and return an object with an action action type and a pillock get this object.

02:08.670 --> 02:12.090
It's going to be sent to all the reducers we can have.

02:12.090 --> 02:16.460
We do Sir's to pretty much to update the redux redux.

02:16.590 --> 02:22.800
Now this reducers are going to receive again this object and since we have a type.

02:22.860 --> 02:29.460
We need to create a reducer with the same name if we have a type but it's movie we create every douceur

02:29.550 --> 02:34.250
with the name movie you know it's going to go right here.

02:34.260 --> 02:36.540
It's going to match the type name.

02:36.540 --> 02:40.450
In this case movie with a reducer a sign for this time.

02:40.510 --> 02:46.730
OK we match movie with movie movie action creator movie type with movie douceur.

02:46.950 --> 02:52.470
Now whenever it's done the reducer is going to grab whatever we have on the payload which is the adjacent

02:52.470 --> 02:58.050
information dates Jason data and it's going to be sent to the application to the provider with the create

02:58.050 --> 02:58.670
store.

02:58.890 --> 03:04.800
And then we just update the read ex-state and once the read Act state it's updated it is going to read

03:04.800 --> 03:06.860
render and just do whatever we want.

03:06.870 --> 03:10.380
And this is going to be react side.

03:11.490 --> 03:16.890
I know this is just a lot of logic to just to update a state.

03:17.040 --> 03:17.650
And you're right.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.850
You know you will be right.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.210
There's a lot of logic.

03:20.220 --> 03:27.810
So the reason why redux it's so popular it's because whenever you just learned to do this process it's

03:27.900 --> 03:31.090
always and always the same idea.

03:31.170 --> 03:37.600
It goes to action sense reducers and then just bring it back and just update the state.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.790
No action reducers opt it's state.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.330
It's always the same idea.

03:42.420 --> 03:47.660
And in a large scale application or you can use it in small application.

03:47.670 --> 03:53.560
It doesn't matter where you make just a lot of requests requests and updates redux.

03:53.610 --> 03:59.100
It's going to make everything simpler because it's always the same process and it works like a charm

03:59.880 --> 04:00.170
right.

04:00.180 --> 04:07.770
So let's go to the next section and create the first reduce or begin to start just from the from the

04:07.770 --> 04:11.310
back begin to start creating our producer in the action create the first.
