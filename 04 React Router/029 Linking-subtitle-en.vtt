00:00.420 --> 00:08.310
OK so since we don't expect for the user to be changing the L manually We need to set some links.

00:08.310 --> 00:10.850
We were just right before this.

00:10.940 --> 00:18.120
We were doing force flash and changing the Eurail manually right here but the user of course is not

00:18.120 --> 00:19.100
going to do this.

00:19.140 --> 00:21.170
We need to use links for this.

00:21.440 --> 00:21.780
OK.

00:21.810 --> 00:28.750
You should be thinking well we should use an ATAC For example if we have a header right here.

00:28.840 --> 00:35.610
Header an inside the header we can have an A within a ref and something else and then just the name

00:35.640 --> 00:36.530
of the route.

00:36.810 --> 00:40.800
Well no this is not going to work at all.

00:40.800 --> 00:49.170
Whenever we use the ATAC in the real world and the non single page app world we are telling the window

00:49.440 --> 00:54.760
that it should be reloading the page and fetch whatever we have right here.

00:55.020 --> 00:59.360
Well this is a single page app and there is no reloading at all.

00:59.370 --> 01:03.210
So the good old ATAC it's no more.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.850
We need to do something else.

01:04.950 --> 01:12.030
So just like me just does just like the browser or the router and the roud we need to import something

01:12.030 --> 01:18.400
else to use links and it's going to be coma and then link to simple site like.

01:18.630 --> 01:19.490
Right.

01:19.530 --> 01:26.070
So to set up a link it's really really simple I'm going to add a link for all the routes we have right

01:26.070 --> 01:26.620
now.

01:26.730 --> 01:35.880
So we just start as a regular task and we say link and then just open and close the link with an ATAC

01:35.910 --> 01:39.490
we can have an H ref for example with a link.

01:39.570 --> 01:44.830
We need to have a two and then equals and then the route which is used to.

01:44.940 --> 01:48.590
That's that's simple says we want to go home for example.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.060
We're going to do a slash.

01:50.270 --> 01:52.700
And I'm just going to set up the link for home.

01:53.090 --> 01:53.790
OK.

01:54.300 --> 02:02.960
So if you want to a link for the posts same idea posts and then posts right.

02:03.510 --> 02:14.490
If you want profile again I'm going to say just profile and then profile I'm going to add a break right

02:14.490 --> 02:23.050
here so they can be in a different line to something simple and do the same thing right here whatever.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.910
And right here at the bottom we're going to have a ruler.

02:28.820 --> 02:29.210
OK.

02:29.570 --> 02:30.980
Something really simple.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.680
There's no need to do something fancy right now.

02:33.890 --> 02:42.140
So if I click home is going to take us home if I go to posts is going to change the L reload the Browse

02:42.350 --> 02:49.010
is going to be always listening it's going to search for the route and show posts posts and the same

02:49.010 --> 02:50.860
idea with profile.

02:50.870 --> 02:57.200
So this is kind of a really straightforward and you're going to be using link a lot in your in your

02:57.200 --> 03:00.210
applications if you're using routes.

03:00.650 --> 03:01.140
OK.

03:01.310 --> 03:05.090
So let's go oh I will tell you something else if I just inspect the page.

03:05.090 --> 03:08.760
Let me just make this bigger just a little bit

03:11.970 --> 03:12.600
go.

03:12.730 --> 03:13.370
OK.

03:14.050 --> 03:17.340
So if I inspect this it's going to be in a simulation.

03:17.440 --> 03:21.930
If I go to home it's just a regular h tag.

03:22.180 --> 03:25.220
So what is happening is that they react and router.

03:25.390 --> 03:30.810
It's converting everything behind the scenes to regular ATAC.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.180
This is of course it's the ATAC whenever we click and react.

03:36.190 --> 03:44.230
It's blocking the default behavior of the ATAC and it's just using react to render what we want to render

03:44.320 --> 03:45.020
of course.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.280
OK that's fine.

03:46.300 --> 03:49.630
So let's go to the next section and talk about perhaps.
