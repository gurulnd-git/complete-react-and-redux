00:00.390 --> 00:07.680
What is re-act writer Well maybe in the future you want to build an application that has more than just

00:07.680 --> 00:08.710
one view.

00:08.850 --> 00:11.790
For example it's going to give you a dumb dumb example.

00:11.940 --> 00:17.980
I mean the code that Facebook Dotcom is going to be the kind of Facebook for developers.

00:18.090 --> 00:21.250
So you have several options right here on the header.

00:21.380 --> 00:23.250
I'm just going to click I guess.

00:23.520 --> 00:29.320
And then it's going into road and it's going to take us to a new route which is going to be Iowa.

00:29.370 --> 00:31.330
And then it's going to show a new view.

00:31.410 --> 00:31.660
Right.

00:31.680 --> 00:32.680
Pretty simple.

00:32.760 --> 00:37.850
So react is just to create a single page single page apps.

00:38.040 --> 00:41.980
So right out of the box we didn't have the ability to do this.

00:42.090 --> 00:48.660
We need to install something else just kind of a middleware or extension or library or whatever you

00:48.660 --> 00:51.670
want to call it so we can change this behavior.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.140
We need to install something first.

00:53.190 --> 00:55.190
And this is called re-act router.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.260
I'm going to just minimize this.

00:57.340 --> 01:01.570
I'm starting with a new project called re-act router to react router.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.500
You can call it whatever you want.

01:03.570 --> 01:08.430
I'm going to go to the view and much we need to always just do the same thing.

01:08.430 --> 01:12.600
Just go to the terminal and create just bring the boiler.

01:12.660 --> 01:14.880
The boiler plate for this.

01:14.880 --> 01:23.970
I'm going to do the same thing before if you remember is going to be create dash re-act dash app and

01:23.970 --> 01:25.020
then just a space.

01:25.170 --> 01:30.150
And since I am inside the folder I want I'm just going to do it.

01:30.420 --> 01:31.330
I'm going to click enter.

01:31.330 --> 01:35.100
It's going to take a couple of minutes and then I'm just going to pause the video and then just come

01:35.100 --> 01:35.750
back.

01:40.820 --> 01:42.960
OK so everything is installed right now.

01:42.980 --> 01:46.830
We have the the the the module for this.

01:46.940 --> 01:52.310
I'm sorry the boulder the boulder played for react so we're going to be using re-act router.

01:52.310 --> 01:58.370
So we need to install this as a node module so we can go again just to the terminal and we're going

01:58.370 --> 02:08.180
to do and PM install and then begin to do react Dasch router dash and Dom.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.140
OK that's what we are going to install.

02:11.150 --> 02:15.070
Begin to be working with the Bush number four so we can do that.

02:15.230 --> 02:18.940
And then just for Dot zero dot zero.

02:19.120 --> 02:19.470
OK.

02:19.510 --> 02:21.060
That's the the fourth release.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.130
So we can work with the same version maybe in the future they're going to be they're going to update

02:25.130 --> 02:29.190
you for power forward for point one or four point something.

02:29.270 --> 02:33.310
And if there's a difference of course I will update the course.

02:33.410 --> 02:36.350
Now we're going to do is space and minus minus.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.550
Safe.

02:37.910 --> 02:38.430
OK.

02:38.510 --> 02:43.060
This is going to save the re-act router inside the package.

02:43.100 --> 02:49.400
Jason Richa it's going to be on the whole list for all the dependencies that we have right here.

02:49.400 --> 02:49.650
So.

02:49.660 --> 02:51.830
OK I'm going to just click enter.

02:52.070 --> 02:58.090
It's going to take again just a couple minutes past the video and then just just move forward.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.590
OK so everything is install right now.

03:00.590 --> 03:01.570
And just like before.

03:01.610 --> 03:07.170
I'm going to go to the public and the source file folder and I'm going to delete the Favia can that

03:08.340 --> 03:11.260
OK and then the manifest Jason.

03:11.790 --> 03:13.640
OK we're just going to leave the index.

03:13.670 --> 03:14.530
That's a e-mail.

03:14.580 --> 03:19.880
Inside the public folder we're going to go to the source and I'm going to read the app.

03:19.890 --> 03:24.530
The TSA is going to the media that J.S..

03:24.800 --> 03:27.760
And then app that test.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.410
We're going to lead the index that says we're going to leave the index that day.

03:32.450 --> 03:39.710
And then just as Weegee and the service workers are going to go inside that index they're just going

03:39.710 --> 03:42.230
to select everything and just delete everything.

03:42.230 --> 03:47.830
We're going to start with a clean clean Spaceward workspace.

03:47.850 --> 03:52.560
I'm going to do NPM start just right now.

03:52.670 --> 03:58.450
It's going to take a few seconds just to make sure that everything it's working ok.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.820
Starting everything should be working fine.

04:03.650 --> 04:06.260
Of course it's not going to work on the screen on the local host.

04:06.400 --> 04:06.920
It is working.

04:06.920 --> 04:10.980
We have these Sibiu inside the local host 3000.

04:11.090 --> 04:12.360
Let's go to the next section.

04:12.370 --> 04:14.370
I'm going to start with re-act murder.
