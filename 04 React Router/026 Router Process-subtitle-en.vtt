00:00.450 --> 00:06.270
OK so let me just give you a slim idea of what what's going happen with Riak router right now.

00:06.340 --> 00:14.300
Without outside the world of single page apps what we used to have is just a page within within yourself.

00:14.340 --> 00:14.710
OK.

00:14.760 --> 00:18.290
Is that just a simple set just a web page with the euro.

00:18.330 --> 00:25.350
Now then if the URL changes is getting a call to the server is going to go to the server where the web

00:25.350 --> 00:31.200
page it's hosted is get a search and find a file that matches this.

00:31.230 --> 00:36.470
The change of your L and then is going to just return return to the web page.

00:36.480 --> 00:42.140
It's going to reload the web page and display the file that matches that you're out.

00:42.150 --> 00:47.880
If we are at for example pages is going to find the folder that calls pages is going to search it find

00:47.880 --> 00:50.470
it and then just reload the page with that file.

00:50.480 --> 00:55.620
So that is what's happening outside the world of single page apps.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.970
Now the single page apps are really really different.

00:58.980 --> 01:02.010
This process is completely different.

01:02.010 --> 01:03.630
Let me show you right here.

01:03.930 --> 01:11.370
We have a web page with with URL and whenever whenever we are just working with a single page apps in

01:11.610 --> 01:15.350
the case of react first we get a history.

01:15.730 --> 01:16.740
We have it right here.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.170
This history.

01:18.270 --> 01:23.630
It's a module that keeps the history log whenever the URL changes.

01:23.640 --> 01:28.860
So this history is going to just keep track whenever the world changes.

01:28.890 --> 01:35.730
And this is just an object Now whenever the oil changes this history is going to be listening for changes

01:35.730 --> 01:36.660
the whole time.

01:36.810 --> 01:44.240
So if there is a change on the Ural the history is the to call re-act router inside re-act router.

01:44.400 --> 01:54.860
We have kind of a list of modules where we specify which your L matches which a component with a component.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.710
So we prematch we have a list with your L and a component.

01:59.130 --> 02:04.890
So if the history changes it's going to call rehang router is going to find the match that your L that

02:04.890 --> 02:11.360
history is passing and it's going to find the module and then Riak router is going to call react is

02:11.370 --> 02:12.600
going to say OK react.

02:12.630 --> 02:17.610
I have this your Ural and you should be showing this component right now.

02:17.820 --> 02:21.740
So re-act is going to grab that component and show it on the screen.

02:21.870 --> 02:25.380
So everything is just inside a tiny module.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.220
So it's kind of different.

02:26.220 --> 02:31.570
We're not going to the server and fetching any kind of information the fetching it's inside the webpage.

02:31.590 --> 02:33.310
The actual web page.

02:33.340 --> 02:33.700
OK.

02:33.720 --> 02:38.090
So let's go to the next section and we can start setting up a route.
