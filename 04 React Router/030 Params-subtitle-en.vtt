00:00.460 --> 00:07.650
OK so let's talk about perhaps what happens if I am inside a posts right here and I have a list.

00:07.650 --> 00:15.400
Let's pretend we have a list and if I click on one of these posts it should be taking us to a new component

00:15.700 --> 00:22.680
which is going to grab the your L graph the ID of the posts and then fetch all the information about

00:23.010 --> 00:24.660
the posts.

00:25.110 --> 00:28.820
Well we need to do something else in order to get this.

00:28.830 --> 00:31.470
And this is called perhaps getting perhaps.

00:31.650 --> 00:38.670
So for example if I click on one of this and it's going to be the post with ID number five the application

00:38.940 --> 00:44.730
is going to go to for Slash number five of course we didn't have a route and we don't have a component

00:44.970 --> 00:45.860
to handle this.

00:45.990 --> 00:49.730
So it's going to take us back to posts to the one that knows.

00:50.220 --> 00:51.030
OK that's fine.

00:51.030 --> 00:53.510
Let's go to our component's view.

00:53.580 --> 01:01.650
And again it created a new component's is going to be posts on her posts item.

01:01.720 --> 01:02.980
That sounds good.

01:03.030 --> 01:12.950
Post item that Jesus ok inside posts items are going to go again to posts just to save some time.

01:13.980 --> 01:15.230
An inside post item.

01:15.270 --> 01:23.910
I'm just going to paste all of this and this is going to be item posts item and we can export posts

01:23.970 --> 01:26.090
item and right here again.

01:26.180 --> 01:29.030
Are you going to say item whatever.

01:29.310 --> 01:35.040
OK let's get I'm going to go to this and I'm going to import the posts item.

01:35.190 --> 01:36.900
OK just like we did before.

01:36.950 --> 01:43.370
Post item import import posts item from.

01:43.410 --> 01:50.440
And then it's going to be DOD for Slash components for Slash and then posts item.

01:50.780 --> 01:52.050
OK that's good.

01:52.170 --> 01:56.540
So now to get programs to get an R U R L that has.

01:56.540 --> 01:59.590
Perhaps we need to do something else right here.

01:59.850 --> 02:02.110
Let me just first do it manually.

02:02.190 --> 02:10.450
I'm going to go and save route and just need to set a path for this and the path is going to be forced

02:10.510 --> 02:15.730
slash it's going to be posts and this one is going to be moving the number 5.

02:15.890 --> 02:17.990
OK so something simple as that.

02:18.490 --> 02:25.710
And the components in charge of rendering rendering this is going to be the Post's item which is included

02:25.710 --> 02:26.940
right here.

02:26.940 --> 02:29.290
Something real simple.

02:29.550 --> 02:35.310
If I read all the Epica application is going to take us two posts and it's going to take us two item

02:35.550 --> 02:42.150
and we have the same problem than before with the exact So we need to go to posts and put exact right

02:42.150 --> 02:44.080
here.

02:44.280 --> 02:51.430
So testing is taking us is recognizing the route and is taking us to these new posts item.

02:51.480 --> 02:55.090
Now if I change this to 10 of course.

02:55.320 --> 03:02.280
Sorry if I change it to 10 right here of course it's not going to show anything because it's going to

03:02.280 --> 03:02.700
fail.

03:02.700 --> 03:08.460
There is no route with posts that slash 10.

03:08.670 --> 03:13.440
So we need to make this feature could of a dynamic.

03:13.590 --> 03:18.650
So we need to do it to a dynamic to recognize an ID.

03:18.750 --> 03:25.660
We get to use the common right here to recognize a pram and begin to say ID.

03:25.840 --> 03:33.560
And if I go to 10 is going to show us item and if I go to whatever 45 it's going to still show item.

03:33.830 --> 03:34.330
Let's.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.680
So it's getting work.

03:35.710 --> 03:39.920
This is the way how we can catch your else with traps.

03:40.100 --> 03:44.320
Now there's one more thing whenever you you're using this.

03:44.320 --> 03:51.960
Remember that the main component domain parent of the whole application is going to be browser router.

03:52.180 --> 04:00.180
So whenever you go to a component in prop's in the prompts of that component the parent components it's

04:00.180 --> 04:00.460
going to.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.400
It's going to have the information of the route.

04:03.400 --> 04:07.010
So let me show you show you what's going on.

04:07.270 --> 04:12.730
I'm going to go right here and I'm going to create a constructor so I can bring the prompts to something

04:12.730 --> 04:17.700
simple OK and then Super just like before.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.420
And then again to bring props.

04:20.470 --> 04:26.550
We did this Pursley props but it is before it.

04:27.050 --> 04:27.510
OK.

04:27.580 --> 04:35.560
So if I go to the render right here and Cancellara the props I'm going to get a lot of information about

04:35.560 --> 04:43.480
the routes so I'm going to say console log and just see check what I have what I have what we have inside

04:43.480 --> 04:48.830
the props and the rule of the page.

04:49.100 --> 04:53.390
So props maybe I met him steak while on second.

04:53.450 --> 04:59.320
Of course whenever we make reference to props we need to say this that props.

04:59.450 --> 05:01.840
It's going to do this for this class.

05:01.940 --> 05:04.200
And the props of this class.

05:04.370 --> 05:05.060
That's good.

05:05.330 --> 05:10.180
So if I go to inspect and I go to the council.

05:10.430 --> 05:16.320
OK let me just because it was all going to go to console and get.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.370
So we have an object right here going to have a lot of messages.

05:19.490 --> 05:23.920
We have a useless constructor and that's fine because we're not using it.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.970
It's just to show you what's happening.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.930
We have an object and we have a lot of information.

05:28.970 --> 05:34.160
We have history location and we have match inside match.

05:34.160 --> 05:41.160
We're going to have all the information about this this route we can have the post ID and the u r l

05:41.330 --> 05:48.950
and the prams and inside perhaps we can have the ID 45 so we can access prompts access prompts that

05:48.950 --> 05:51.350
match and get this information.

05:51.500 --> 05:59.170
So if am if I go right here and make reference to this prompts going to I can do this.

05:59.300 --> 06:08.890
That prompts dot match dot pro-ams and inside perhaps we can have the ID.

06:09.350 --> 06:16.570
So when the page reloads I get the ID so we have access to the ID of the page inside posts.

06:16.700 --> 06:24.890
Since we have the ID we can ground the ID and make a network with requests to fetch the posts with this

06:24.890 --> 06:25.440
ID.

06:25.460 --> 06:30.320
Something real simple right here is giving us the message useless constructor.

06:30.320 --> 06:33.970
So we are using a class but we are using.

06:34.070 --> 06:37.610
We are using a constructor but we are not really using it.

06:37.610 --> 06:43.820
So its not a good practice practice to use a constructor an empty constructor.

06:43.820 --> 06:47.690
So again I'm going to refactor this just for fun too.

06:47.750 --> 06:54.890
Stateless components we can have a contest and the contest is going to be post item and this is going

06:54.890 --> 07:01.400
to be a call to something we're going to put it in a minute and we just run a function.

07:01.490 --> 07:06.080
This is going to return some depth with some information inside.

07:06.110 --> 07:13.100
Now whenever we we catch everything right here inside prompts we can pass prompts right here.

07:13.370 --> 07:13.980
OK.

07:14.270 --> 07:15.470
And this is going to work.

07:15.470 --> 07:22.280
The thing is that well we need to if we have props right here we only to access the two prompts that

07:22.280 --> 07:24.810
match that Priam's that ID.

07:25.010 --> 07:29.050
So what we can do we can directly access to match.

07:29.060 --> 07:36.540
We can use make use of some destructuring just like we did with component around just some ESX magic.

07:36.800 --> 07:44.410
And inside here since I have access to match what I can do is just grab the match grab the programs

07:44.750 --> 07:51.080
and then the ID and the page loads and we get the ID right.

07:51.110 --> 07:51.860
So that's good.

07:51.910 --> 07:58.190
Oh right here computing it's defined but never used since we know we have a stateless component we have

07:58.190 --> 08:01.420
media component so everything should be fine right now.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.480
OK that's good.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.920
This is a different message.

08:04.290 --> 08:07.940
So OK so we have four or five with a status component.

08:08.120 --> 08:13.370
We know how to get the IDs and how to use dynamic pram.

08:13.370 --> 08:14.850
Let's go to the next lecture.

08:14.870 --> 08:17.570
We're going to talk a little bit more about router.
