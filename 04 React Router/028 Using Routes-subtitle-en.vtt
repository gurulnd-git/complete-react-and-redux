WEBVTT

00:01.110 --> 00:08.010
OK so when the page loads we need to start using routes right now when the application loads the first

00:08.010 --> 00:13.770
component that we are showing the main entry point a point of the application is going to be the app

00:13.820 --> 00:14.490
components.

00:14.500 --> 00:15.650
It's right here.

00:15.690 --> 00:18.000
So this is not going to work for us.

00:18.180 --> 00:25.230
Whenever the application loads browser router is going to decide which component should render on the

00:25.220 --> 00:27.240
screen giving the Ural.

00:27.270 --> 00:28.240
We have here.

00:28.500 --> 00:33.120
So I'm going to delete this just like this and make some space.

00:33.270 --> 00:38.520
So just like with this app we need to use the browser router and it's going to be everything just like

00:39.020 --> 00:40.440
in attack mode.

00:40.670 --> 00:41.290
OK.

00:41.820 --> 00:45.450
So to say to pass the application is going to load.

00:45.480 --> 00:49.690
It's going to bring Riak router and we do Jaro.

00:50.010 --> 00:54.330
And inside here inside the router we need to set up the routes.

00:54.540 --> 00:58.850
So again this is just a strike is pretty direct straightforward.

00:59.070 --> 01:02.700
We need to use something that's called route.

01:03.510 --> 01:07.100
Now the route is going to take some attributes first.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.870
Going to be the path the path is going to be the URL.

01:10.920 --> 01:14.120
Pretty much it's going to be the URL that we need to listen.

01:14.280 --> 01:20.520
So for example if you wanted to go to posts is going to be for Shlash because for us is going to be

01:20.550 --> 01:27.010
cavity index the main page like home and then posts here.

01:27.210 --> 01:33.930
OK so if we go to four Shlash posts browse and Rohter is going to notice that this is happening and

01:33.930 --> 01:40.930
it's going to try to find a route that has forced flash posts so that's good.

01:41.120 --> 01:49.450
So the second argument the second attribute that we need to past is which component re-act should render.

01:49.740 --> 01:55.190
So I'm going to say component's proponents tingler.

01:55.440 --> 01:59.280
This one is going to be kind of a with color braces right here.

01:59.310 --> 02:06.720
It's not we the quotes and right here we need to pass the name of the components we want to render.

02:06.720 --> 02:11.390
In this case it's going to be posts and we imported the posts right here.

02:11.520 --> 02:14.720
So I'm just going to copy this and say posts.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.160
Ok so this is fine.

02:17.190 --> 02:20.140
I'm going to repeat the same process with profile.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.780
Can it go right here at the bottom.

02:21.810 --> 02:23.540
I'm going to say profile.

02:24.080 --> 02:24.530
OK.

02:24.800 --> 02:31.440
So we need to render the profile just copy and paste and just say profile and let's get.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.300
So this should be working.

02:33.450 --> 02:35.640
But of course it's not going to work.

02:35.700 --> 02:41.530
It's going to say a router might have only one child element just like render.

02:41.550 --> 02:45.180
We need to return only one element.

02:45.270 --> 02:48.420
Right here we are returning to elements.

02:48.420 --> 02:51.580
So what we do and this is just kind of a workaround.

02:51.840 --> 02:55.610
We enclose everything in a container just like render.

02:55.650 --> 03:01.260
We put everything inside a day for span or whatever and the same idea we apply the same idea right here.

03:01.260 --> 03:04.800
We put everything inside a DEP wrapper.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.570
Now notice that I am at home but nothing is happening.

03:07.590 --> 03:12.890
Nothing happens is because we didn't have a route for that we're going to do that in a couple of minutes.

03:13.080 --> 03:13.450
OK.

03:13.500 --> 03:20.560
So if I go to four slash posts it should be rendering the posts component is going to be shared.

03:20.580 --> 03:22.330
So it should be sane posts.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.770
Ok so let me try it.

03:24.780 --> 03:26.820
I'm going to go to posts.

03:27.430 --> 03:33.300
Ok we get posts let's get let's try the same thing with profile profile.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.370
OK.

03:34.510 --> 03:36.390
We get profiles so it's working.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.070
Let's get right.

03:38.070 --> 03:40.290
So let's set up the way home.

03:40.320 --> 03:50.040
For example I can go again and say route open and close the path is going to be just a false flash because

03:50.040 --> 03:53.930
it's going to be home up for Slash.

03:53.970 --> 03:54.680
There you go.

03:54.900 --> 04:01.520
And the component that should render in home is going to be a component and then app.

04:01.530 --> 04:03.150
All right that's fine.

04:04.640 --> 04:11.820
This is weird whenever you're just rendering this just like this you're saying OK.

04:11.840 --> 04:18.330
Whenever you have a force slash inside the crowd just show the app components and it's showing home.

04:18.350 --> 04:20.150
So that is get is correct.

04:20.270 --> 04:24.690
But then inside profile for example we have the force in action.

04:24.770 --> 04:30.950
So the kind of the browser router and the routes get kind of confused and it's showing you the profile

04:30.980 --> 04:32.100
because profile.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.030
It's true.

04:33.350 --> 04:37.490
It has a force slash and it's kind of weird but it's not happening to post.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.940
But anyways this is not right.

04:40.010 --> 04:45.600
So re-act is going to it's going to reverse is going to give you two choices.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.300
Give us two choices.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.820
One is the exact keyboard.

04:50.030 --> 04:55.240
And then we have the switch we can use the switch in a couple of lessons a couple lectures.

04:55.340 --> 05:03.770
So for now we can get used one method react it's ask and so react router is asking you to use the exact

05:04.490 --> 05:05.700
keyboard right here.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.220
It's just like a setting.

05:07.250 --> 05:12.970
So whenever we want to exactly match for Slash we'd use exact.

05:13.010 --> 05:18.980
And if we have a full profile it's going to show profile but if we are home is just going to show home

05:19.100 --> 05:27.410
because we have the exact right here and if we go to our no again just posts is just going to show posts.

05:28.380 --> 05:29.860
All right that's good.

05:29.940 --> 05:30.970
That's enough for now.

05:31.090 --> 05:37.230
Oh let me show you one more thing right here inside the router just like we are we in inside the render

05:37.560 --> 05:41.040
we can we can show pretty much whatever we want if I want to.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.270
Hetter right here.

05:42.480 --> 05:45.570
I can just create a div that's going to of.

05:45.600 --> 05:51.630
This could be a component for example that it's going to be Hetter is going to be the main header of

05:51.630 --> 05:52.620
the application.

05:52.710 --> 05:58.020
So whenever the application loads it's just going to show that components if you have a bunch of sea

05:58.020 --> 06:02.410
of GSX right here is going to still show it on every route.

06:02.430 --> 06:05.490
If I go to Home posts we get the header.

06:05.670 --> 06:11.610
If I go to profil right here we are still getting the header.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.140
And if I go home we get the letter.

06:14.560 --> 06:14.910
OK.

06:14.970 --> 06:15.770
That's good for now.

06:15.870 --> 06:18.600
Let's go to the next section and talk about linking.
