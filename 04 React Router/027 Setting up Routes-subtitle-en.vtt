WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:03.510
OK so we have a clean project.

00:03.690 --> 00:07.430
So we need to have an index page which is going to be indexed on jazz.

00:07.620 --> 00:11.860
And then two different sections a profile page and the Post's page.

00:11.910 --> 00:15.510
So we're going to start building the template for this.

00:16.190 --> 00:21.090
I've chosen to start from scratch so we can practice this a little bit.

00:21.090 --> 00:26.880
So first we need to import re-act from re-act that it's the first always the first thing we need to

00:26.880 --> 00:27.430
do.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.050
It's going to be important.

00:29.970 --> 00:31.650
And then just react.

00:31.920 --> 00:36.130
And since we are going to use a class we're going to bring components.

00:37.230 --> 00:37.500
OK.

00:37.530 --> 00:43.740
We're going to bring the bring it from reactor so it's going to be from re-act the thing we need is

00:43.740 --> 00:44.590
going to be the react.

00:44.590 --> 00:48.380
DAUM this is going to be the main JSA inexactly.

00:48.530 --> 00:52.180
So we're going to render everything through the re-act from Dom.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.900
So I'm going to say important.

00:55.260 --> 00:56.110
All right.

00:56.190 --> 00:59.610
And then just react dumb.

00:59.940 --> 01:01.200
So it's going to be from.

01:01.530 --> 01:05.090
And then Bre-X Dom.

01:05.120 --> 01:05.710
All right.

01:06.060 --> 01:11.760
So we're going to use a class to use class and this one is the first one so it's going to be called

01:11.820 --> 01:12.630
apt.

01:12.650 --> 01:20.130
I'm going to do extents and we can extend component just just like before.

01:20.310 --> 01:23.420
This is we need to render something so we can do the render.

01:23.940 --> 01:30.430
And inside the render we can return just a simple Deppe it's going to say home something simple simple

01:33.380 --> 01:33.960
water.

01:33.980 --> 01:34.730
OK.

01:35.310 --> 01:40.440
Now we need to use that react on the render method so we can render this app.

01:40.440 --> 01:49.650
So we're going to call the re-act dumb dot and then just render this render takes two arguments pretty

01:49.650 --> 01:53.140
much first is going to be the want and then it's going to be the where.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.070
So what is going to be app.

01:56.490 --> 01:58.530
And then just open close.

01:58.530 --> 02:03.840
And the second argument is going to be the where if we go to the index then yes we need to select a

02:03.840 --> 02:09.510
div that is going to be the main kind of the wrapper of the whole application.

02:09.620 --> 02:11.940
And right here by default we have root.

02:12.150 --> 02:24.490
So I'm going to go back to index just closes and it can say documents don't query selector inside here.

02:24.510 --> 02:28.950
Just compute an ID of fruit just like before.

02:29.280 --> 02:29.750
All right.

02:30.030 --> 02:32.660
So if we redo the application we get help.

02:32.670 --> 02:34.160
So this is working.

02:34.620 --> 02:38.430
So inside the same project we can have two different groups.

02:38.520 --> 02:42.260
The route of profiles and the route of posts.

02:42.340 --> 02:48.020
So I'm going to go to a source and I have a component's folder right here.

02:48.150 --> 02:51.300
So we need to add two different files.

02:51.300 --> 02:55.500
One is going to be the first one is going to be posts and the other one is going to be profile.

02:55.680 --> 03:06.810
So I'm going to say posts that jazz and then profile that jazz right and just like before I get to go

03:06.810 --> 03:11.480
to posts and we pretty much repeat the same process.

03:11.670 --> 03:14.920
Can I just close it and I'm going to bring re-act from react.

03:14.940 --> 03:18.490
I got a copy from here just to have something simple.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.050
It's going to be posts.

03:20.280 --> 03:26.490
So we have a class that is going to be called posts and extents components

03:29.100 --> 03:30.880
right inside.

03:30.900 --> 03:35.680
We can have a render and render is going to return.

03:35.970 --> 03:43.980
It's going to return a div that has posts just so we can make sure that we are on the correct webpage

03:44.190 --> 03:45.570
or the correct view.

03:45.900 --> 03:52.740
And of course we can X10 begin to export sorry export default.

03:53.340 --> 03:56.920
And then just the name of the class which is posts.

03:56.970 --> 03:57.640
All right.

03:57.850 --> 04:02.930
I got a copy of this just to save a little bit of time and I'm going to go to profile.

04:03.030 --> 04:05.210
It's pretty much the same thing.

04:05.220 --> 04:12.810
The only thing that this class is going to be called profile and we export profiles right here.

04:13.050 --> 04:16.100
And inside here I can say profile.

04:16.710 --> 04:17.010
Right.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.150
So everything is ready.

04:18.180 --> 04:19.860
We have the two routes.

04:19.920 --> 04:25.390
Now what we need to do is to bring something else to use re-act router.

04:25.800 --> 04:33.560
So the thing is that to use re-act router since this is so lively we need to import it right here.

04:33.570 --> 04:34.500
It's not inside.

04:34.530 --> 04:40.800
It's not by default inside we act or component or react on we need to import it just like we are importing

04:40.800 --> 04:41.710
react.

04:41.760 --> 04:48.760
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to say import and just going to make an empty collar basis.

04:48.980 --> 04:53.010
And I'm going to say from and then react.

04:53.010 --> 04:58.030
It's going to be Dasch router bash Dom.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.160
That's the first thing.

04:59.260 --> 05:00.170
OK.

05:00.580 --> 05:04.310
Now inside here we're going to bring the first thing we're going to bring.

05:04.420 --> 05:08.110
It's going to be browser and then router.

05:08.320 --> 05:15.160
That's the first thing we are going we're going to break this a browser router is going to be the object

05:15.220 --> 05:20.630
that is going to interact with history and knows what is happening with the L.

05:20.680 --> 05:24.160
If I go back to the chart this is going to be the browser router.

05:24.460 --> 05:25.040
OK.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.240
So that's the first thing we need.

05:27.250 --> 05:30.280
The first one on the list then we're going to use a different one.

05:30.310 --> 05:35.330
It's going to be called route and it go do a coma and say route.

05:36.010 --> 05:44.180
This route is going to be the one in charge of receiving the information that it's being sent by browser

05:44.200 --> 05:52.120
a router and check which route matches that you are l and and it's going to instantly know which components

05:52.150 --> 05:53.110
we should use.

05:53.170 --> 05:56.920
And then it's going to go to react and pass that information.

05:57.040 --> 06:01.350
So this route is going to be this this one right here on the list.

06:01.870 --> 06:02.780
Let's go back.

06:02.810 --> 06:05.330
Going to bring to home.

06:05.710 --> 06:06.150
OK.

06:06.220 --> 06:07.130
So that's fine.

06:07.150 --> 06:09.900
So everything is pretty much done.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.560
We're going to use the re-act router right here.

06:12.700 --> 06:20.660
So we need to import all the paths all the components that they are going to be inside the routes they're

06:20.680 --> 06:26.310
going to go right here just like for chrissake components components.

06:26.590 --> 06:33.230
And of course I'm going to say import and then posts from an insider here.

06:33.260 --> 06:42.190
Dot for Slash it's inside components for Slash posts and we repeat the same process with profile.

06:42.220 --> 06:53.710
It's going to be import and then profile up profile from and then just sending components for Slash

06:53.710 --> 06:54.900
and then profile.

06:55.270 --> 06:55.850
OK.

06:56.170 --> 06:59.590
So everything is ready so we can use the re-act router.

06:59.770 --> 07:04.380
So let's go to the next section and set except the Riak react router up.
