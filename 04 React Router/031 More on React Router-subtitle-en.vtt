WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:05.700
OK so I want to talk about some extra features we have with every writer.

00:06.020 --> 00:08.030
I wouldn't talk about such.

00:08.070 --> 00:12.270
Remember that we were using exact to fix the problem with the droughts.

00:12.360 --> 00:17.110
Well we have a different option but this we have something that calls such.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.950
So I'm going to do a search right here.

00:18.970 --> 00:22.940
Going to bring switch from re-act rider.

00:23.150 --> 00:23.700
OK.

00:24.090 --> 00:25.250
So what do we need to do.

00:25.290 --> 00:29.190
We need to wrap everything inside switch.

00:29.590 --> 00:31.330
Just going to do it right now.

00:32.100 --> 00:36.820
And this is just like a regular switch invented jazz.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.220
So with the switch is just going to check the or else.

00:40.350 --> 00:44.250
And if it's there's no match it's going to go to the next one and then in the next one and then the

00:44.250 --> 00:44.790
next one.

00:44.820 --> 00:52.560
Of course the problem with this is that if you have on your L that it's really really specific This

00:52.560 --> 00:55.870
one should go on the top so he can match first.

00:55.890 --> 00:59.280
So that's something that we need to do.

00:59.280 --> 01:07.560
I'm going to go right here first one this one is really specific going to go in profile and this one

01:07.560 --> 01:08.360
right here.

01:08.490 --> 01:10.220
This one is going to be the index.

01:10.350 --> 01:12.940
It's the more of a global one.

01:12.960 --> 01:18.840
So I'm going to leave that one at the ends so if I go to home get home it go to posts.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.080
We get posts.

01:20.130 --> 01:21.720
Same thing with profile.

01:21.720 --> 01:27.860
And if I go to posts for Slash something that's working that's good.

01:28.190 --> 01:28.460
OK.

01:28.470 --> 01:29.180
One more thing.

01:29.220 --> 01:35.290
What happens if you want to use a 4 0 4 kind of a page not found.

01:35.430 --> 01:35.880
OK.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.230
So what we can do.

01:37.250 --> 01:43.040
Oh and I'm going to really the exact I forgot to do that on the show that is still working.

01:43.950 --> 01:46.180
Post profile and everything else.

01:46.500 --> 01:57.480
So if you have a four for round up I made a I made a for for component before recording the video just

01:57.480 --> 01:58.350
to save time.

01:58.560 --> 02:05.210
So whenever I just that there is no match inside the routes it should be going to this 4 or 4.

02:05.230 --> 02:07.310
No it's just a page not found.

02:07.590 --> 02:11.790
So what we can do we can again just set around for this.

02:12.120 --> 02:19.400
Inside the switch and the path is going to be pretty much all with the asterisks which is pretty much

02:19.410 --> 02:25.170
we are saying right here that it should match all the analysis should be this should be run running

02:25.440 --> 02:32.930
on all the rails and the component that should be should the showing is going to be the page not found

02:32.940 --> 02:33.580
component.

02:33.630 --> 02:35.990
I just created.

02:36.230 --> 02:37.460
So I'm going to copy that.

02:37.470 --> 02:39.000
Not found.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.230
Go right here.

02:40.620 --> 02:40.810
OK.

02:40.830 --> 02:50.460
If I go to home it's going to show home and if I just type any or just a dummy Eurail whatever is going

02:50.460 --> 02:51.420
to show.

02:51.690 --> 03:00.260
So the thing I said Riak router the Ivory's we are Roder the Bushin number for just a few months ago

03:00.870 --> 03:08.680
and we actually we we used to have used the version number three and that one could have worked nicely.

03:08.700 --> 03:14.720
This one has a lot of books and they are just kind of fixing fixing the books along the way.

03:14.910 --> 03:17.830
So the switch is going to fix and exact.

03:17.880 --> 03:18.940
It's kind of a fix.

03:19.020 --> 03:21.880
So everything works best with some books.

03:22.140 --> 03:25.600
So if we won this notice that is a switch.

03:25.740 --> 03:33.880
So when we reach the fourth flash this means it's kind of a global and it matches whatever you're out.

03:34.140 --> 03:35.090
So what do we need to do.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.020
Again we use the exact

03:39.680 --> 03:40.680
Just like we did before.

03:40.700 --> 03:44.420
But this just for the home and everything else is just working fine.

03:44.420 --> 03:45.570
We have the four or four.

03:45.770 --> 03:49.520
If you go to oppose home everything else works fine.

03:49.940 --> 03:50.210
OK.

03:50.240 --> 03:53.130
Let's go with something else.

03:53.300 --> 03:58.930
Right now we are using the pretty much the default format for you or else.

03:59.030 --> 04:05.440
What happens if you want to use a different one if you come from framework's like angular.

04:05.570 --> 04:07.970
Or number one for example.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.860
If you remember you have kind of the you are as kind of a force Slash has a knack for Slash.

04:13.010 --> 04:15.860
So you're using hashes as well.

04:15.950 --> 04:16.880
So we can do this.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.990
We can still do this instead of browser router.

04:20.150 --> 04:22.770
I'm going to import hash router.

04:23.240 --> 04:29.420
So if I go to hash router and plays that you are l it's going to be hash.

04:29.450 --> 04:38.780
I go to profile is profile hash posts hash or not really go back home hash posts profile and everything

04:38.780 --> 04:39.500
else.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.440
I think this is going to work with a hash.

04:41.570 --> 04:43.140
Let's get now.

04:43.160 --> 04:50.900
What happens if you don't want to have to mutate the state for example of the of the Eurail.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.460
You can still do that.

04:52.460 --> 04:57.960
It's we need to import something else that it's called Memory router.

04:58.190 --> 05:02.610
So the memory router is going to keep everything in memory.

05:02.600 --> 05:07.770
You know this is not just like a it's not a real Eurail just behind the scenes.

05:07.790 --> 05:12.660
So instead of just showing it's not showing anything it's doing everything behind the scenes.

05:12.800 --> 05:19.470
So if you go to posts it's taken me two posts but it's not updating the URL.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.720
And if you go to profile.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.060
Same idea.

05:22.070 --> 05:26.750
All right let's get a different way to do things.

05:26.750 --> 05:27.850
It's up to you.

05:28.070 --> 05:35.550
I pretty much I use always the I always use the default one the common one and that's it.

05:35.570 --> 05:39.220
You know the again this is just up to you.

05:39.260 --> 05:40.160
We have one more.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.410
I have one more feature I want to show you.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.000
We have the map link.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.030
You can go right here and import Napp link.

05:47.120 --> 05:52.130
It's going to be not link and I'm going to bring the browser router.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.750
Again just because I just like that one.

05:55.240 --> 05:55.870
OK.

05:56.180 --> 05:57.410
So the Napp link.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.250
It's really awesome.

06:00.500 --> 06:05.190
Instead of having the link the nobbling It's like a replacements for link.

06:05.270 --> 06:08.520
If we have a nap and nap just inside the.

06:08.660 --> 06:15.260
So instead of using the link I'm going to use link going to go right here and just nothing is going

06:15.260 --> 06:19.960
to reload the page and everything else is just going to be the same.

06:19.970 --> 06:25.760
The thing is that with Netlink it's going to give us two different properties we can use for example

06:25.820 --> 06:32.700
if we are home we can go to the snap link and pass two different options one.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.230
The first one is going to be active style.

06:35.300 --> 06:42.650
So if the euro matches with the link is going to change the it's going to add some styles and then we

06:42.650 --> 06:46.060
have a different option that is going to be active class name.

06:46.310 --> 06:51.650
Again if it matches it's going to add a class to that element to that link.

06:51.650 --> 07:00.230
So if I go and say active style it's going to be equal to collaborators and in react to adding classes

07:00.800 --> 07:02.720
dynamically just in.

07:02.900 --> 07:08.990
I need to put everything into curly braces so I want to change the color.

07:08.990 --> 07:11.880
I'm going to say color and the corner is going to be red.

07:12.170 --> 07:16.880
So when the page loads the home is going to be read to go to posts.

07:18.100 --> 07:21.140
Of course we need to set all the routes.

07:21.210 --> 07:23.650
I'm just going to do it right now for fun.

07:26.910 --> 07:32.900
So it's if it's active.

07:33.010 --> 07:35.060
OK well there's something happening.

07:35.280 --> 07:40.190
I believe that this is the exact thing the exact that we are using right now.

07:40.200 --> 07:44.890
It's one of the books I was telling you I just discovered maybe a bug.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.940
Well that's fine whatever.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.260
Then they go back and just use the To.

07:50.430 --> 07:55.440
Whatever you want whenever you are just there is a match with an Aveling you just it's going to change

07:55.440 --> 07:56.610
the color whatever.

07:56.730 --> 07:57.230
OK.

07:57.480 --> 08:03.330
So the next one is going to be active class name is going to go right here and it says active class

08:03.330 --> 08:03.880
name.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.700
And I would use this one.

08:05.730 --> 08:07.650
The other one is really buggy.

08:07.700 --> 08:11.330
So like this one is going to be selected.

08:12.110 --> 08:12.390
OK.

08:12.420 --> 08:19.400
So if I just reload the page to go to home I go to home and I just inspect everything.

08:21.150 --> 08:24.350
It's going to go OK.

08:24.780 --> 08:28.370
It's going to go home and it's going to have a class of selected.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.330
So again I'm leaving.

08:30.330 --> 08:35.780
I believe that it's kind of a failing because of the exact and the paths that we have right here.

08:35.790 --> 08:39.500
Maybe we will need to use to use that workaround.

08:39.860 --> 08:40.300
OK.

08:40.560 --> 08:42.040
I want to show you something else.

08:42.120 --> 08:47.900
I'm going to give you a link of the guides for the Riak router.

08:48.060 --> 08:51.170
If you have the right here the guides.

08:51.420 --> 08:56.660
So it's nice to have you have a lot of information and you have a lot of features.

08:56.790 --> 09:03.740
So if you want to just take a look you can go to react training Riak router and you have the right here

09:03.740 --> 09:04.680
at the API.

09:04.870 --> 09:05.250
OK.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.750
Let's change the subject.

09:07.770 --> 09:13.650
What's going to talk about something else we're going to talk about something that it's really important

09:13.860 --> 09:14.690
for react.

09:14.730 --> 09:16.270
It's going to be in life cycles.
