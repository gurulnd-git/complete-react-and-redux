00:00.180 --> 00:06.590
OK so the next lifecycle is going to be components will receive prompts.

00:06.740 --> 00:12.570
And well the thing is that we already know how this one's work so we can assume what's going to happen

00:12.570 --> 00:16.310
when we do component will receive prompts.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.460
So I'm going to do it right here.

00:17.460 --> 00:26.160
It's going to be components and then we'll receive props props.

00:26.340 --> 00:27.410
Right.

00:27.540 --> 00:32.780
So this one is going to be called whenever this component it's getting you props.

00:32.870 --> 00:35.180
So I'm going to say console log.

00:35.340 --> 00:43.370
And then just before receiving prompts some something real simple before receiving prompts.

00:43.410 --> 00:43.970
There again

00:47.220 --> 00:48.420
let's get whatever.

00:48.430 --> 00:52.880
So the thing is and this is why it's going to fail.

00:53.080 --> 01:01.120
If I go to lifecycle and I'm going to go right here manually so I can show you nothing is going to happen

01:01.210 --> 01:06.310
before we get the before component gets created and after a component it's mounted.

01:06.520 --> 01:14.800
So whenever the application loads this one will not be called because this one will trigger after the

01:14.860 --> 01:17.760
component receives new prompts.

01:17.860 --> 01:24.800
It's not called when the component starts with the component starts it gets some props but it's not

01:24.830 --> 01:25.790
well received.

01:25.810 --> 01:27.690
OK it's not going to trigger this one.

01:27.730 --> 01:35.140
If I click on live again the we get to receive some prompts from re-act router OK.

01:35.170 --> 01:39.940
But the components it's already on the screen is not going to just create the component again.

01:39.940 --> 01:41.910
We already have it right here.

01:41.980 --> 01:51.180
So if I click life we get before receiving prompts so the prompts are from the Riak router again.

01:51.220 --> 01:53.200
So we are getting new props.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.660
Either they are the same props but we are getting props again.

01:56.680 --> 02:01.090
So that's why it's calling this component will receive prompts.

02:01.090 --> 02:02.700
All right so we have one more.

02:02.890 --> 02:08.880
We have the components will unmount and we will maybe use this one in the future.

02:08.880 --> 02:16.060
We're going to go right here at the bottom and it's going to be components of components.

02:16.570 --> 02:20.480
And then just will and unmount.

02:21.230 --> 02:21.750
OK.

02:21.850 --> 02:22.640
Let's get.

02:22.880 --> 02:29.260
So this one again it's pretty obvious whenever we just destroy this component we just go to a different

02:29.260 --> 02:30.310
component.

02:30.310 --> 02:36.890
Whenever we unmount reacts unmount the the the this view.

02:36.910 --> 02:42.770
This component is going to trigger a function and it's going to be this one component will and mount

02:43.390 --> 02:45.780
It's a console log.

02:46.090 --> 02:51.250
And then just announce something just something like that.

02:51.580 --> 02:51.850
OK.

02:51.880 --> 02:58.460
If I'm going to be inside lifecycle if I go to profile you get unmounted and mount.

02:58.840 --> 03:06.370
So again before everything gets destroyed with this component it's going to call to the final lifecycle

03:06.640 --> 03:12.910
it's going to be this one and this one it's kind of a useful let's say that maybe in the future you

03:12.910 --> 03:19.540
will need to clear some state or you will need to do something before going to a different view.

03:19.570 --> 03:23.430
You need to do something on the state or something on a global variable.

03:23.520 --> 03:28.000
Well you can do it with the component will unmount before destroying the component.

03:28.030 --> 03:34.530
You just do whatever you want to do inside here it is going to go to the next component without conflict.

03:34.780 --> 03:38.350
Let's get that one what this one is really really useful.

03:38.470 --> 03:38.980
So that's good.

03:38.980 --> 03:43.390
This is the components of lifecycle the re-act lifecycle.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.850
It's really really useful.

03:44.890 --> 03:47.450
You might be thinking why are we going to use this.

03:47.530 --> 03:54.370
Well we're going to use maybe not all of this life cycles but we're going to use pretty much the component

03:54.370 --> 03:57.420
will mount the mount and a couple more.

03:57.420 --> 04:02.530
But that said OK we just use it for some particular things.

04:02.860 --> 04:03.110
OK.

04:03.130 --> 04:05.650
Let's go to the next section.
