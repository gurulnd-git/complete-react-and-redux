00:00.480 --> 00:07.170
OK so now we're going to talk about component's life cycles whenever re-act starts the application and

00:07.170 --> 00:13.810
it starts building and the component or it's going to update or receive data or receive props or whatever.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.320
Reac re-act does everything insteps.

00:17.550 --> 00:20.430
So it's going to just follow a pattern.

00:20.430 --> 00:25.530
First is going to one is going to get the default state.

00:25.530 --> 00:33.630
So we're going to get the fault state first is going to do that is the first step then the second one

00:33.840 --> 00:37.190
is going to set initial state.

00:37.530 --> 00:42.190
Then the third task is going to be before the component gets created.

00:42.210 --> 00:49.360
So it's going to be before it gets created then it's going to render the IJA sex.

00:49.470 --> 00:56.310
So we can say render Jair Sex and the last thing it's going to do is to call to a method that is going

00:56.310 --> 00:59.760
to be just put for right here.

00:59.790 --> 01:00.090
OK.

01:00.120 --> 01:05.110
And the fifth position is going to be after a component it's mounted or created.

01:05.140 --> 01:12.040
So I'm going to say after a component is mounted right.

01:12.120 --> 01:16.210
So don't worry I can explain you right now with a practical example.

01:16.230 --> 01:22.510
So OK so first react is going to start to hold cation and have made a new entry.

01:22.710 --> 01:25.320
It's going to be call lifecycle.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.180
I've added it right here in the routes.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.240
So I ams inside lifecycle is give me an.

01:31.260 --> 01:34.580
Because this is not a valid component of course.

01:34.590 --> 01:43.770
So first I'm going to say import import re-act from react so we can use GSX begin to bring the component

01:43.850 --> 01:45.540
is going to be a class.

01:46.170 --> 01:52.860
And of course we know this and then it's going to be import from and then just react after a while.

01:52.860 --> 01:55.540
This is kind of a natural.

01:55.530 --> 01:59.940
So OK we're going to start our class and this class is going to be called lifecycle.

01:59.940 --> 02:00.940
It's going to be class.

02:01.110 --> 02:08.630
And then just life cycle and going to make everything just in lowercase.

02:08.940 --> 02:10.500
And this going to extends.

02:10.590 --> 02:13.400
And then just a component just like always.

02:13.960 --> 02:19.880
OK so now the first thing that is going to happen I'm just going to cut copy right here.

02:19.980 --> 02:24.100
The first thing that it's going to happen is going to get to default state.

02:24.240 --> 02:30.390
So whenever it gets the default state is going to do it from the constructor it's going to get the prompts.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.640
It's going to go to the probs and get a default state.

02:33.660 --> 02:42.240
If we have one of course and let me just make sure right here I'm going to say export default and lifecycle

02:44.700 --> 02:45.130
OK.

02:45.160 --> 02:49.510
So whenever we get the full state which is the first thing that it's going to do it's pretty much what

02:49.510 --> 02:52.290
we've been doing right now on the Prue's lectures.

02:52.300 --> 02:59.340
It's just grabbing the constructor bringing the prompts and then just calling the super That's it.

02:59.350 --> 03:06.700
This is the first step that re-act is going to do and it's just a lifecycle then it's going to set an

03:06.700 --> 03:07.810
initial state.

03:07.810 --> 03:11.600
And of course if you have a state it's going to set the initial state.

03:11.620 --> 03:20.200
We're going to do that does that state and it calls to something again it put some dummy data can say

03:20.220 --> 03:21.330
tidal.

03:21.670 --> 03:29.430
Pulp fiction fiction in Cinemax whatever.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.200
I'm just going to put something else.

03:31.210 --> 03:37.920
It's going to be the tie that the body of news and it's just some some dummy text.

03:37.960 --> 03:38.330
Right.

03:38.410 --> 03:38.840
Let's get.

03:38.860 --> 03:39.740
That's fine.

03:40.240 --> 03:45.820
So this is going to be the second the second rule that's going to set the initial state and this one

03:45.850 --> 03:51.400
it's interesting before it gets created now before it's rendering everything.

03:51.420 --> 03:57.020
And before it's showing something on the screen is going to do something else.

03:57.310 --> 04:04.150
So this is going to be called component will mountains and this is something that you're going to hear

04:04.180 --> 04:04.840
a lot.

04:04.960 --> 04:13.510
It's going to be component and then just will everything is in camel case and mount and this is going

04:13.510 --> 04:16.650
to be a fancy function just a just like render.

04:16.740 --> 04:22.030
So inside the compound will mounth is going to do something before everything it's rendered is going

04:22.030 --> 04:23.470
to trigger dysfunction.

04:23.530 --> 04:30.850
And if we put some code right here this code will be executed before rendering anything in on the screen.

04:30.850 --> 04:37.360
So I'm going to say I'm just going to do a console log and the console log is going to bits and just

04:37.450 --> 04:47.880
some dummy text is going to be before before component's gets created just like that.

04:47.890 --> 04:48.640
All right.

04:48.970 --> 04:53.610
So the four position the fourth step is going to be rendering the GSX.

04:53.620 --> 04:55.910
And we've been doing this already.

04:55.930 --> 05:02.110
We already did this is going to be render and inside the render just open and close and then we just

05:02.110 --> 05:04.590
return some GSX.

05:04.860 --> 05:05.410
OK.

05:05.650 --> 05:11.860
So I hear I'm just going to return something that we have on in the state just some dummy text.

05:11.890 --> 05:13.010
It's going to be d of.

05:13.120 --> 05:20.560
And then H-1 that's going to make it smaller 8 4 and it's going to be a con..

05:20.670 --> 05:22.560
I'm sorry we're going to show the title.

05:22.570 --> 05:23.060
So it's going to.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.180
Does that state the title.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.030
OK.

05:27.520 --> 05:34.850
So then we're going to show the body we're going to do a break and then just show the body.

05:34.850 --> 05:35.160
OK.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.380
So it's dev.

05:36.940 --> 05:43.260
And this idea of again just does that state DOT body.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.470
OK that's fine.

05:45.470 --> 05:52.000
So it's going to work if the application is going to give me the title and some dummy text.

05:52.210 --> 05:54.860
Let's get let them just remove the break.

05:55.330 --> 05:55.700
OK.

05:55.810 --> 06:02.260
So this is the fourth step the fourth lifecycle is going to be the render then just like before it gets

06:02.260 --> 06:06.990
created we have after a component it's mounted or it's created.

06:07.270 --> 06:13.060
And this one is instead of component will mount its component did mounted.

06:13.180 --> 06:19.340
So the names kind of make sense now component will mount and mount.

06:19.600 --> 06:28.420
So it's going to be again everything in Coulon case is component's dead mount and it's just a function

06:28.450 --> 06:36.720
just like the other one and this one I'm going to say just console comes along and becomes a lock.

06:36.790 --> 06:43.840
It's going to be I don't know whatever we can to put after a component it's mounted of course after

06:44.110 --> 06:53.950
our component is mounted right so the page reloads it's outputting the text and it's right here it's

06:53.950 --> 06:56.300
going to say before component gets created.

06:56.490 --> 07:00.910
It's going to output it before the component did mount again.

07:01.000 --> 07:09.070
So the class starts the Capones starts is going to do the constructor then set the initial state then

07:09.190 --> 07:11.260
trigger that component will mount.

07:11.410 --> 07:16.840
It's going to come to this function then it's going to render and then component did mount after everything

07:16.840 --> 07:17.480
is created.

07:17.680 --> 07:23.540
That's why we it's we that's why we are getting the consul log after the before.

07:23.560 --> 07:33.520
So if I just caught this and paste it before the decomposed will mount it is still showing the before

07:33.610 --> 07:34.730
and then the after.

07:34.930 --> 07:38.240
So this is not changeable this is always after the render.

07:38.350 --> 07:41.300
And this is always before the render.

07:41.500 --> 07:45.900
So I'll go back just give you a practical example.

07:45.900 --> 07:51.040
Let's say that we want to change the color of the 8:4.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.480
So if I go to the compound will mount going to go right here.

07:54.620 --> 07:59.540
I'm going to say document just select that from the dorm directly.

07:59.550 --> 08:06.520
We shouldn't do this but whatever course selector and then begin to select that age for tag.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.240
OK.

08:07.330 --> 08:18.660
Beginning to enter the style of style that color and equals and something that we can notice it's going

08:18.660 --> 08:19.380
to be red.

08:19.560 --> 08:24.810
So the application is going to reload and it's going to give us an error message it's going to say cannot

08:24.810 --> 08:25.590
read properly.

08:25.590 --> 08:26.940
Style of no.

08:27.060 --> 08:32.000
So we are trying to access an element that it's not on the dorm.

08:32.280 --> 08:36.860
And this is because we are calling it before the component gets created.

08:36.870 --> 08:43.440
So whenever we call this this information doesn't exist yet and this is just one of the beauties of

08:43.980 --> 08:50.130
every act we can call and do things before everything is rendered and after everything is rendered and

08:50.130 --> 08:53.460
ready on screen we can call this and use this.

08:53.460 --> 09:00.520
So if I do it at the end I'm going to do it on the component that mount is going to work for sure.

09:00.550 --> 09:08.100
I read the page is changing the title The color because this exists on time.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.900
OK that's fine.

09:09.900 --> 09:14.370
Let's go to the next lecture and talk about a little bit more about life cycles.
