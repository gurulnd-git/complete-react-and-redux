WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:08.100
OK so we have access to the lifecycle of react when creating a component we have the before the actual

00:08.100 --> 00:11.950
render and then the after component it's rendered.

00:12.090 --> 00:12.760
Right.

00:12.810 --> 00:13.460
That's good.

00:13.590 --> 00:17.740
So we also have access to the Whenever we act.

00:17.760 --> 00:19.250
It's updating a state.

00:19.370 --> 00:21.020
It's pretty much the same idea.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.690
Right now we have the component will mount.

00:23.910 --> 00:26.860
So with the update it's going to be just real simple.

00:26.910 --> 00:28.010
It's going to be components.

00:28.020 --> 00:29.770
We'll update we're going to do that.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.010
So it's going to be component.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.990
And then just will everything come case and then update.

00:36.990 --> 00:37.660
Right.

00:37.680 --> 00:43.710
So when a call component would update is going to do console log before it gets updated.

00:43.710 --> 00:47.490
So this function is going to trigger before updating a state.

00:47.550 --> 00:54.040
So I'm going to say Before Update right since we have the before.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.000
We also have the after.

00:56.110 --> 01:03.720
So is going to be components components and then that update just follows the same rules that components

01:03.730 --> 01:04.540
did mount.

01:04.780 --> 01:06.390
So it's going to be update.

01:06.490 --> 01:07.830
Right.

01:07.860 --> 01:11.660
And in SSB-B update I'm to I'm going to do a console log.

01:12.060 --> 01:13.810
And then after update.

01:13.870 --> 01:14.230
Right.

01:14.280 --> 01:17.460
Makes sense right.

01:17.490 --> 01:19.940
So now I need something to change the state.

01:19.950 --> 01:22.440
I'm going to add a button right here.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.940
Get it at something or do something simple.

01:24.990 --> 01:29.250
It's going to say Dev and Dave is going to have a click listener.

01:29.310 --> 01:32.400
It's going to be unclick just like we did before.

01:32.700 --> 01:37.680
And this is going to be a fad or a function and it's going to be it's going to update the state.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.200
So we're going to do this.

01:39.240 --> 01:45.730
That said state and city state we're going to change the title just something simple.

01:45.730 --> 01:51.970
We're going to say tidal and this is going to be called to something else that's fine.

01:51.990 --> 01:56.760
Something else right might just make it everything in one time.

01:57.100 --> 01:57.410
OK.

01:57.420 --> 01:58.220
Let's get.

01:58.230 --> 02:00.130
So if a reload the page.

02:00.410 --> 02:04.640
Let me just put something click to change right.

02:05.070 --> 02:12.110
So if I clicked this div is going to update the state it's going to change the title for something else.

02:12.180 --> 02:16.160
It's going to show it right here on the screen because we are using the state.

02:16.170 --> 02:20.120
And then it's going to go and trigger that before updating.

02:20.120 --> 02:25.710
And once it's updated it's going to just trigger the console log after update.

02:25.830 --> 02:32.120
OK so I'm going to go look at something else and you get before update and then just after update.

02:32.280 --> 02:36.910
So again whenever we update state we have the access of doing something else.

02:36.930 --> 02:41.610
Let's say that we have an application where the user needs to click on something and then you just need

02:41.610 --> 02:47.660
to check some data and do after something after the state gets updated.

02:47.660 --> 02:49.890
So this is going to useful.

02:49.950 --> 02:53.590
We have one more and this one is not that simple.

02:53.640 --> 03:01.570
So we have one that says shoot skin it starts like that is going to be shrewd.

03:02.350 --> 03:11.670
There you go should and it's going to be component update shit component update just like that.

03:11.670 --> 03:15.900
But this one is it's something else we're going to do something else with this one.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.870
This should component update.

03:17.940 --> 03:19.930
It takes two arguments.

03:20.010 --> 03:27.730
It's going to be the next prompts and then the second argument is going to be the next state.

03:27.810 --> 03:33.860
So this arguments are going to be the next property is the next data that are sending.

03:33.990 --> 03:37.050
And the next state of course makes sense.

03:37.050 --> 03:42.000
So this one this function it's always going to return false.

03:42.090 --> 03:43.570
So I'm going to say return.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.240
I'm sorry it's going to always return true.

03:45.300 --> 03:45.890
True.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.590
If I say return false it's not going to update.

03:48.600 --> 03:54.020
We can force the component not to update with the shift component update.

03:54.060 --> 03:59.360
And of course we can do more I'm going to put falls right here just to prove this.

03:59.430 --> 04:02.100
Going to click change and nothing happens.

04:02.490 --> 04:09.800
So since this one is returning false we are just preventing for the for the component to update.

04:09.810 --> 04:17.850
So if I just return true and redo the application I'm going to click change and it's going to pass.

04:17.850 --> 04:21.020
Now let me just comment this again.

04:21.030 --> 04:21.820
Go right here.

04:21.820 --> 04:23.280
I'm going to do.

04:23.450 --> 04:25.430
Lock and again a console.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.690
That does not state that title.

04:27.910 --> 04:28.150
OK.

04:28.220 --> 04:34.060
This dot state DOT DOT title right.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.080
So this is going to cancel the title The actual title.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.590
Right click it.

04:39.040 --> 04:43.510
We're going to get an R of course and it's going to say pulp fiction in us.

04:43.610 --> 04:43.820
OK.

04:43.830 --> 04:47.380
So we get the actual title before updating.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.670
OK let's get.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.370
Now if I say console log.

04:50.640 --> 04:56.260
And the next state the title is going to get something else console log.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.530
Going to be next state.

04:58.560 --> 05:03.210
Going to just copy that title.

05:03.740 --> 05:09.240
You never load the page going to click it get an error but we get something else.

05:09.420 --> 05:16.920
So right here we have access to the current the current state and even though we are not updating this

05:16.920 --> 05:19.830
one is catching the next update.

05:19.860 --> 05:23.570
For example we're getting something else on the next state.

05:23.880 --> 05:27.960
So with this one what we can do we can evaluate things.

05:27.960 --> 05:34.450
I mean the current state and the next state and decide if you want to update or not.

05:34.650 --> 05:38.610
Let's say I have a just an if statement we're going to do something simple.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.760
Going to say if and then just nothing.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.390
OK I'm going to evaluate something right here.

05:44.460 --> 05:52.820
I'm going to say if next state that title because we are accessing the title is going to be trivially

05:52.830 --> 05:58.070
equal to something else we can return false

06:01.660 --> 06:06.690
OK if not if this is not true it's going to return true.

06:06.740 --> 06:11.160
It's going to pass.

06:11.270 --> 06:12.070
That's good.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.800
So I'm going to make a tiny change.

06:13.810 --> 06:16.610
I'm going to go right here instead of something else.

06:16.660 --> 06:21.120
It's going to be something else seen without the.

06:21.260 --> 06:27.780
And if I just clicked change is going to go because this one is passing a false and a.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.020
And it's not true.

06:29.020 --> 06:30.510
Of course there's no match.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.790
And it returns True.

06:31.930 --> 06:38.200
But if I just correct it and go else and I could change it's not passing.

06:38.410 --> 06:45.520
So right here we just can evaluate the current state and the next state or some dummy data and decide

06:45.520 --> 06:49.110
if you want to move forward in updating the state or not.

06:49.300 --> 06:51.620
So it's really really useful.

06:51.810 --> 06:52.190
OK.

06:52.270 --> 06:55.440
Let's go to the next section and finish with the lifecycle.
