00:01.350 --> 00:03.990
OK so now we're going to talk about promp types.

00:04.170 --> 00:12.170
What are Propp types so prep times was a built in ability of re-act for type checking.

00:12.240 --> 00:15.980
Now it was included by default and previous versions of react.

00:16.110 --> 00:21.630
Now just like transition's group we will need to install an add on to use prompt type so we will need

00:21.630 --> 00:23.810
to install a dependency for this.

00:23.820 --> 00:29.820
So before you start explaining Propp types and to express that you might never use proc type prop types

00:30.330 --> 00:36.780
if you want to be a good developer but you will need to use Propp types if you don't want to use promp

00:36.780 --> 00:37.400
types.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.340
Your application is going to work just fine.

00:40.460 --> 00:41.020
OK.

00:41.310 --> 00:43.530
So prop types are for type checking.

00:43.530 --> 00:46.900
Let me just show you the chart so you can understand this.

00:47.160 --> 00:52.010
And if you're still interested you can just move forward OK with this section.

00:52.140 --> 00:57.120
So we're going to have Pearn component for example with the state of name last name and age.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.620
Just something real simple.

00:58.850 --> 01:03.420
The Sprint component is going to call to Achaia components.

01:03.540 --> 01:05.440
It's going to pass all the prompts.

01:05.610 --> 01:06.030
OK.

01:06.060 --> 01:13.890
With a name last name and age Propp types is going to be listening inside of this component whatever

01:13.980 --> 01:19.080
the child component receives the new props with name last name and age types.

01:19.100 --> 01:25.910
It's going to check if they have the correct values if something is wrong it's going to throw a warning.

01:25.920 --> 01:32.310
So let's say that name has has a string for example it by default you should be getting a string.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.350
But instead you get a number name.

01:34.470 --> 01:40.650
Well Prop types after each set up is going to check if name has the string if it has a number.

01:40.650 --> 01:41.960
It's going to give you a warning.

01:42.030 --> 01:48.570
So this is the main essence of prop types is just type checking is going to check if everything is correct.

01:48.660 --> 01:54.840
If it's not going to let you know day dude you forgot to do this or I'm getting a different value.

01:54.840 --> 02:02.030
So OK before we start with prop types if you're still interested we need to install this as an add on.

02:02.040 --> 02:07.770
So I'm going to go right here at the bottom and I'm going to say NPM install and then it's going to

02:07.770 --> 02:16.800
be called prop up IPN install and then space and promp is going to be Dash and types and is going to

02:16.800 --> 02:18.400
be mine is mine is safe.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.670
I'm using a new project.

02:20.670 --> 02:26.730
Again there's no need for you to type everything or just copy the project is going to be available in

02:26.730 --> 02:27.320
get have.

02:27.450 --> 02:28.880
I'm just going to show you what we need to do.

02:28.890 --> 02:29.420
OK.

02:29.670 --> 02:32.410
So it's install and being installed Propp types.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.550
Mannesmann is save is going to install.

02:34.550 --> 02:40.200
It to take a few seconds and again to stop the video and just move to the next section and start using

02:40.340 --> 02:40.800
types.
