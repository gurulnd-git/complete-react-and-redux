WEBVTT

00:01.620 --> 00:03.930
OK so we can check more things with promp types.

00:03.930 --> 00:06.390
We have some methods available for this.

00:06.480 --> 00:10.280
I'm going to come in this one the name and I'm going to use it as an example.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.680
What we can do we can check for an array of values.

00:13.680 --> 00:18.190
I'm going to use the name and again to say Dot and then just call the prompt types again.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.800
And the method it's going to be called one off.

00:21.930 --> 00:25.250
Now inside the one off method begin to pass an array.

00:25.470 --> 00:32.550
And what we can do we can specify right here which elements which names we are expecting.

00:32.550 --> 00:39.040
For example I'm going to say Frances and Frances if we see Frances prompts it's going to be good.

00:39.300 --> 00:44.080
If I received James for example it's going to it's going to be good and it's going to pass.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.020
But if we receive something else it's going to fail.

00:47.150 --> 00:53.010
They're going to go to app and I'm going to say Frances so that espousing are going to say James relo

00:53.010 --> 00:55.440
the app and it's going to pass.

00:55.560 --> 00:59.400
And if I say Ron of course is going to fail.

00:59.500 --> 01:03.120
So you know this one it's kind of useful.

01:03.120 --> 01:08.520
I'm just going to go back and say Francis Francis good.

01:08.820 --> 01:11.600
So we have some other useful methods.

01:11.820 --> 01:15.730
Notice that I'm using I'm just commenting the name right here.

01:15.840 --> 01:20.060
If we use two prompt types with the same name you can get it.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.740
And again an error message.

01:21.750 --> 01:24.390
So make sure that you're using one for all.

01:24.460 --> 01:27.990
They're going to come in both of this going to go right here at the bottom.

01:28.240 --> 01:32.340
Well what we can do we can we can have a method that it's kind of a switch.

01:32.530 --> 01:36.210
JSH is going to be called one off type.

01:36.210 --> 01:42.210
What we can do we can check for several rules inside the same prop type and if at least one of them

01:42.300 --> 01:45.890
it's passing everything is going to pass just like a switch.

01:46.100 --> 01:51.160
I'm going to call the name and let me show you a practical example because it's kind of confusing.

01:51.210 --> 01:55.410
It's going to be one of type is the method.

01:55.410 --> 01:58.070
And inside here we have an array of values.

01:58.110 --> 02:05.640
So what we can do right here is we can pass different types going to pass that it should be a string

02:06.030 --> 02:10.160
and we could receive a number as well to something simple.

02:10.650 --> 02:11.190
OK.

02:11.670 --> 02:14.840
So right now is the name you're getting Francis.

02:14.850 --> 02:16.040
This is string.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.570
So it matches this rule.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.880
So it's going to pass.

02:20.100 --> 02:27.300
If I just go back and change Francis and put the number five it's going to pass of course because we

02:27.300 --> 02:29.030
have a number as a rule.

02:29.310 --> 02:36.930
If I go back and use an array it's going to be Frances is not going to pass because we are expecting

02:37.400 --> 02:39.180
a string or a number.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.100
OK that's good.

02:40.140 --> 02:42.080
This one is useful as well.

02:42.100 --> 02:48.610
I going to go back and just set Francis back again so he can pass.

02:49.320 --> 02:49.780
OK.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.530
Now we have one more thing.

02:51.870 --> 02:55.800
We have the array of right here hand hobbies.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.080
We have an array of strings.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.320
What we can do in a beat just come in the Humvee's right here.

03:01.530 --> 03:08.820
What we can do we can check if an array is an array of numbers or an array of strings.

03:08.850 --> 03:16.680
So I'm going to say Harvey's of the go back again hobby's if Javier's is going to be a proper time and

03:16.680 --> 03:21.300
then just check if it's an array of strings or of numbers.

03:21.510 --> 03:26.490
So the method is going to be called Auray off and it's a method.

03:26.520 --> 03:35.190
And inside here we can pass whatever rule one is going to be promp types and we want to check if this

03:35.280 --> 03:38.100
array is an array of strings.

03:38.310 --> 03:47.370
Since it is going to pass I mean if I say number is not going to pass because we have an array of strings.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.730
OK that's good.

03:48.930 --> 03:52.040
Let me just go back so he can it can pass.

03:52.070 --> 03:54.270
I would think I like the error messages.

03:54.270 --> 03:56.690
So OK we have a couple more.

03:56.820 --> 04:05.640
We have the is required let's say that your application is expecting for value and that that prompt

04:05.790 --> 04:08.830
it's really important for your application.

04:09.060 --> 04:14.680
So what you can do you can mark that property that prompts as required.

04:14.850 --> 04:23.480
So I'm going to use the mother example right here for mother to read it and see mother and the mother

04:23.510 --> 04:28.250
is going to be Martha just a name and I'm going to say mother.

04:28.350 --> 04:30.550
And then again called to prop types.

04:31.080 --> 04:37.290
It's going to be promp types and this one is going to be a string of course.

04:37.450 --> 04:40.960
And what we can do we can mark this one as required.

04:41.230 --> 04:48.280
So whenever the application loads and we see the props if this mother it's not there it's going to give

04:48.280 --> 04:49.180
us an error message.

04:49.180 --> 04:51.200
Since we have it it's going to pass.

04:51.370 --> 04:58.630
But if I delete it really does is going to give us an error message is going to say that monitor is

04:58.630 --> 05:00.380
required.

05:00.460 --> 05:01.150
Let's get to.

05:01.180 --> 05:05.720
Let me go back so he can pass.

05:05.900 --> 05:06.760
Right.

05:07.710 --> 05:07.950
OK.

05:07.970 --> 05:09.020
We have one more.

05:09.110 --> 05:12.180
And this one is really really useful.

05:12.290 --> 05:17.930
So sometimes maybe you want to check for some things and other methods that prompt types is going to

05:17.930 --> 05:20.950
give you there are just not suitable for that.

05:21.140 --> 05:22.100
So what you can do.

05:22.100 --> 05:26.650
You can create a custom prompt type are going to use the mother example again.

05:26.660 --> 05:31.270
I'm just going to comment this one out and I'm going to use the mother example.

05:31.490 --> 05:34.800
So with the mother what we can do we can run a function.

05:34.880 --> 05:39.380
So I'm going to say function is here and she's going to open it close.

05:39.500 --> 05:45.290
This function is going to receive three different arguments by default.

05:45.410 --> 05:52.490
The first one is going to be prompts the second one is going to be promp name name.

05:52.490 --> 05:53.410
There we go.

05:53.420 --> 05:58.960
And the third one is going to be a component name.

05:59.100 --> 05:59.690
Right.

05:59.930 --> 06:03.130
So this one I've never used is one that can put a name.

06:03.170 --> 06:10.130
So of course the component name but this ones are the one we care prompts is going to be the key of

06:10.130 --> 06:10.960
the value.

06:11.150 --> 06:16.440
So since we are checking mother prompts it's going to be this is going to be mother.

06:16.850 --> 06:23.300
And then just proper name is going to be the whatever you're getting inside the mother as a value.

06:23.630 --> 06:31.130
So if I went to check for something inside this mother I could check if we are getting a name of that

06:31.140 --> 06:32.300
I don't know Jane.

06:32.480 --> 06:36.360
And if we are not getting Jane we should get an error message.

06:36.490 --> 06:36.840
OK.

06:36.860 --> 06:44.240
Just like with regular jazz I mean to say if and if something happens we get a return true or a returner

06:44.590 --> 06:48.200
or if and if it's false it's going to just return false.

06:48.230 --> 06:49.300
Let's get.

06:49.320 --> 06:57.590
So I'm going to say if prop's which is the name of the key which is mother and value which is a proper

06:57.590 --> 07:04.630
name this is going to be equal to whatever we're getting inside mother in this case we get mother and

07:04.630 --> 07:05.510
Martha.

07:05.510 --> 07:08.660
So this is equal to Martha right now.

07:08.660 --> 07:15.470
So if this value that we are saving it's different for us from something else from Jane for example

07:16.820 --> 07:19.650
we should be throwing an error message.

07:19.760 --> 07:27.310
Now the way to return an error message it's not going to be just return false just like we always do.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.660
We need to do something else.

07:28.670 --> 07:33.650
We're going to return and we can in return a new error.

07:33.650 --> 07:35.510
We just do it like that.

07:35.510 --> 07:43.150
And inside the error we're going to have to add in a message for here just new error.

07:43.460 --> 07:47.820
And for example if I say hey error is going to load the page.

07:48.890 --> 07:50.240
And we're going to get that message.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.070
It's going to be a hey error.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.910
So I got to make something I'm going to put something right here.

07:55.040 --> 07:55.930
That makes sense.

07:56.060 --> 08:01.230
I'm going to use the name and then we can use again template strings.

08:01.330 --> 08:09.090
You can just ESX going to save prompts and the name of the whatever value we are getting which is proper

08:09.090 --> 08:10.370
name.

08:10.370 --> 08:16.200
Remember we have right here if the if this value it's not.

08:16.260 --> 08:25.350
No it's not it's incorrect to say that it's incorrect and then it should be Jane.

08:25.740 --> 08:28.090
So this message kind of makes sense.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.330
Let me just.

08:29.880 --> 08:35.520
So if I just read the application and we get the message because it's not Jane it's going to be Martha.

08:35.750 --> 08:38.490
We get the name Martha is incorrect.

08:38.570 --> 08:39.490
Should be Jane.

08:39.680 --> 08:45.710
So again when they discussed some function you can just create a custom rule and just return whatever

08:45.710 --> 08:47.840
message you want.

08:47.840 --> 08:53.600
All right so you have this or this are just some options you got with prompt types.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.480
You have much more.

08:55.530 --> 09:02.070
We're going to show you right now I'm going to go right here and the I'm going to pass you on your we're

09:02.090 --> 09:10.060
all going to be PM J.S. package and promp types and right here you have the API of promp types and you

09:10.060 --> 09:15.870
can have pretty much the whole list of what you can check and you can have some examples of course.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.610
Well all right.

09:17.620 --> 09:21.930
So this is enough for the promp types topic.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.390
Let's go to the next thing on the list.
