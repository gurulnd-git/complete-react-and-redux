WEBVTT

00:02.150 --> 00:04.460
Okay everything is installed and running.

00:04.710 --> 00:10.740
Let me just tell you what I have right here to tell you something about this component this app I have

00:10.740 --> 00:16.140
right here I have an app component is going to have a state and inside the state we're going to have

00:16.140 --> 00:18.950
a name with the string last name with a string.

00:19.110 --> 00:23.220
You're going to have an H with the number Humvee's with an array.

00:23.250 --> 00:31.110
Spanish with a boolean value are going to have a function then an object and then just a string again.

00:31.110 --> 00:37.620
And this component is going to render a child component and right here inside the user community which

00:37.620 --> 00:45.460
is the child component again to pass all this state right here all the prompts inside the user component.

00:45.960 --> 00:49.580
I'm just receiving the prompts and rendering the prompts.

00:49.590 --> 00:51.300
No this that prompts that name.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.970
Just something real simple.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.570
OK that's fine.

00:54.750 --> 01:01.490
So what I want to do I want to start using prompt and want to check all the prompts that this component's

01:01.560 --> 01:02.990
it's receiving.

01:03.120 --> 01:08.290
So I'm going to go right here at the top and first since promp types it's it's an add on.

01:08.310 --> 01:14.650
We will need to import Propp types mislay import and then Propp types.

01:14.850 --> 01:15.550
Right.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.920
It's going to be from and then from.

01:17.940 --> 01:22.530
It's going to be Propp then dash types.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.390
OK let's get.

01:24.380 --> 01:26.220
So it's ready now.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.970
What we never hear of properties is defined but never used.

01:29.970 --> 01:31.960
It's because we're not using it so far.

01:32.190 --> 01:38.310
So to use prop types since we're going to be checking all the prompts that this component is receiving

01:38.970 --> 01:44.710
the first keyword that we need to use is going to be the name of the class.

01:44.760 --> 01:52.470
So we're going to go right here and say user Aunty's productize beginning to do Propp types.

01:52.470 --> 01:57.220
Now that way it's going to be prototypes now types.

01:57.230 --> 01:57.900
All right.

01:58.190 --> 01:59.920
So it's going to be equal.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.630
And then it's going to be equal to an object.

02:02.630 --> 02:03.640
Now what are you going to do.

02:03.650 --> 02:08.160
We can check the name begin to check the last name and we can check the age.

02:08.180 --> 02:15.350
So since they want to check the name the proper name they're going to say name and then just can just

02:15.350 --> 02:19.610
like an object and to check this name with prop types.

02:19.640 --> 02:28.040
First I need to use the keyboard prop types and then I need to I'm going to do Don and I need to use

02:28.040 --> 02:28.920
the word.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.710
And this ward is going to be kind of the.

02:31.830 --> 02:34.290
The thing that promp types is going to check.

02:34.520 --> 02:42.650
So if this name is going to receive some text here it's going to receive text string with Frances.

02:42.830 --> 02:46.790
So since we want to get a string we're going to say string.

02:47.260 --> 02:51.490
And if I just relo the application the message goes away and everything is good.

02:51.740 --> 02:57.260
So now that's do the same thing with last name is going to be the last name and last name is going to

02:57.260 --> 03:01.430
say prototypes and then dot it's going to be strings.

03:01.430 --> 03:03.260
Well we have a last name right here.

03:03.260 --> 03:07.850
It's going to be JONES Just string now the third one is going to be the age.

03:07.860 --> 03:12.370
So I'm going to say age come and I'm going to call again to prop types.

03:12.540 --> 03:18.900
And since this one is going to be a number I'm going to do something else I'm going to put that number

03:19.670 --> 03:26.550
all right and everything goes correctly because with age of course we have a number.

03:26.610 --> 03:30.950
So what happens if I change the number to the age string.

03:31.710 --> 03:35.160
So we are saying that age should be string and ok we get a warning.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.600
Let me just show you the warning right here.

03:37.650 --> 03:45.350
He's going to say failed prom type in ballot Prop H of views type number supplied to user expected string.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.740
So we are turning right here.

03:46.770 --> 03:53.280
We're telling prompt types that this age should be a string and not a number but instead we are getting

03:53.280 --> 03:53.920
a number.

03:54.060 --> 03:56.310
So prompt types is just giving you a warning.

03:56.430 --> 03:57.650
Everything is going to just work.

03:57.660 --> 03:59.100
It's going to work beautifully.

03:59.280 --> 04:05.400
But you get the warning and the main idea of using prop types is that you're just kind of a body dating

04:05.460 --> 04:06.150
everything.

04:06.360 --> 04:11.490
And maybe in the future you're going to create an application and that application is going to go maybe

04:11.490 --> 04:16.770
to a different developer and do the developers going to start doing things.

04:16.980 --> 04:23.760
And if you have prompt types the developer is going to instantly know that you should be expecting this

04:23.760 --> 04:26.160
values and not other values.

04:26.190 --> 04:28.200
So this is the main idea of promp types.

04:28.410 --> 04:36.360
So I'm going to go back and say a number of everything is going to just pass so we can check a lot of

04:36.360 --> 04:43.410
things with this but sometimes the next thing we need to check after the age is going to be hobbies

04:43.740 --> 04:46.100
and hobbies is going to be an array.

04:46.230 --> 04:48.440
So again we just follow the same principle.

04:48.550 --> 04:54.040
It's going to be Harvey's and Heavy's is going to be promp types.

04:54.360 --> 05:00.180
And since we have an array it's going to be array and it's going to reload and everything is going to

05:00.180 --> 05:00.650
pass.

05:00.690 --> 05:02.570
Let's get the next one.

05:02.730 --> 05:03.970
It's going to be the language.

05:03.990 --> 05:06.140
Spanish is going to be a boolean.

05:06.180 --> 05:09.330
So we're going to go right here and say Spanish.

05:09.360 --> 05:17.790
No I'm sorry it's language or it was Spanish is a Billing's So it's Spanish sorry Spanish is going to

05:17.790 --> 05:18.450
be a boolean.

05:18.450 --> 05:20.880
So again we say promp types.

05:21.450 --> 05:28.600
And since we want to check we want to say that this one is going to be a boolean we use bool b o l of

05:28.620 --> 05:31.390
boolean and everything is going to pass.

05:31.410 --> 05:34.260
The next thing is the message for a message.

05:34.260 --> 05:35.290
We have a function.

05:35.460 --> 05:43.860
So again same idea in a coma and it's going to be message calling prompt types and prompt type since

05:43.860 --> 05:44.660
it's a function.

05:44.910 --> 05:48.710
We say thank you Nic.

05:48.960 --> 05:49.410
I.

05:49.530 --> 05:50.840
Everything passes.

05:50.940 --> 05:52.620
The next one it's going to be car.

05:52.650 --> 05:54.740
So car is an object.

05:54.750 --> 05:57.290
So what we can do we can check if we have an object.

05:57.300 --> 06:04.260
This is is a simple concept car and then just call the promp types dot and it's going to be an object

06:04.260 --> 06:06.310
so we say object.

06:06.780 --> 06:08.800
And again everything is going to pass.

06:08.870 --> 06:13.520
So this is the main idea of proper types is really really simple.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.030
And again if you want to use it well then just use it.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.910
It's a good idea to use it if you don't want to use it.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.950
No problem it's still going to work.

06:21.960 --> 06:22.560
All right.

06:22.770 --> 06:23.200
So OK.

06:23.220 --> 06:27.950
Let's go to the next section and check some other features with prompt types.
