00:00.690 --> 00:06.270
OK so I want to talk about controlled and uncontrolled components control component.

00:06.280 --> 00:13.260
It's whenever we use react in 100 percent of that sample we use react 100 percent.

00:13.470 --> 00:14.050
OK.

00:14.230 --> 00:16.320
And an uncontrolled component.

00:16.510 --> 00:20.880
It's whenever we bypass react for example using graphs.

00:21.210 --> 00:28.690
The best example and this comes directly from re-act playbook it's working with forms.

00:29.190 --> 00:35.640
So I have a component right here and I'm going to just create just transfer and transform this to a

00:35.640 --> 00:37.820
control component.

00:37.830 --> 00:45.120
Now we just have just one form with a name and a last name and we have just one default state.

00:45.270 --> 00:50.430
And I want to do whenever we type something inside here I want to update the state.

00:50.430 --> 00:50.780
Right.

00:50.820 --> 00:52.380
So we know this.

00:52.380 --> 00:56.960
We did this in the past with the events of the onchange events.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.790
So it's the same idea going to do on and then change.

01:01.110 --> 01:08.460
And whenever we call the On Change when we are we are getting that event once call to a function and

01:08.460 --> 01:16.950
this function is going to be call handle name and then change whether we go right here and cannot just

01:16.980 --> 01:18.660
create this function.

01:18.660 --> 01:22.580
This function is going to be fat R-OH function.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.760
And whenever we call this function we pass on an event.

01:26.880 --> 01:30.410
So I'm going to put events as in arguments.

01:30.630 --> 01:34.850
Now since we have this function what we can do we can update the state.

01:34.950 --> 01:36.860
So I'm going to do this.

01:36.880 --> 01:41.530
Dodd said state and I'm going to update the state of name.

01:41.550 --> 01:44.120
It's going to say name that cone.

01:44.220 --> 01:49.400
And here we have divans say event target dot value.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.750
We've overdid this before.

01:52.340 --> 01:53.170
OK.

01:53.250 --> 02:00.030
Just to save time I'm going to do the same thing the same logic with the last name is going to be handle

02:00.490 --> 02:01.970
last.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.680
Last Name the last name.

02:04.680 --> 02:09.820
Let's go get a copy of this going to copy the function at the bottom.

02:09.830 --> 02:16.470
Just copy and paste for now going to change the name of the function and instead of updating the state

02:16.470 --> 02:20.880
of name going to update the last name that will get no errors.

02:20.880 --> 02:23.280
So it means that this is get.

02:23.430 --> 02:29.570
Now I want to just check whatever we are getting on the new state whenever we update the state.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.320
I want to see it.

02:31.530 --> 02:37.500
So I'm going to use the component will update remember with a component when update we pass the next

02:37.500 --> 02:44.350
prompts and the next state so we can bew we can just inspect the next state.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.150
OK that's fine.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.230
There is no need to lose time with this.

02:49.470 --> 02:56.010
I'm going to just reload the page and if I enter Francis we are getting it right here on the new state

02:56.020 --> 02:56.830
then the next date.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.620
So we get the name of Francis.

02:58.660 --> 03:02.060
Are Just updating the state successfully.

03:02.190 --> 03:09.510
And if I do last name of Jones Jones we got name and last name of John.

03:09.510 --> 03:11.130
So the state is fine.

03:11.130 --> 03:12.900
We are updating the state.

03:13.420 --> 03:13.750
OK.

03:13.770 --> 03:17.230
So this form this component.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.610
It's still an uncontrolled components.

03:20.980 --> 03:23.620
We are managing everything through react and the state.

03:23.760 --> 03:30.810
But the thing is that the whenever we entered a war here just of some characters we're doing it doing

03:30.810 --> 03:34.080
it directly with Dawn.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.750
We are just entering the information manually.

03:36.870 --> 03:40.680
We are we are just interacting with the impot directly.

03:40.890 --> 03:46.380
And this is under control behavior because we react.

03:46.380 --> 03:52.590
It's not controlling whatever it's happening inside the input it's just getting what what it's inside

03:52.590 --> 03:55.830
the input but it's not assigning a body to the input.

03:56.400 --> 04:04.500
So to make this a control component instead of just just living this set is what we can do and I'm just

04:04.500 --> 04:09.960
going to riddle the application for now going to go right here and I'm going to just say value and this

04:09.960 --> 04:12.920
value is going to be empty.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.120
Let me show something.

04:14.430 --> 04:20.710
Right now I'm going to just type some letters and notice that nothing is going to happen.

04:22.080 --> 04:29.030
And right here you can see in the state that for each key I'm hitting is just adding that to the state.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.800
But it's just one letter.

04:30.840 --> 04:36.840
The thing is that whenever the application starts it's going to render this components and the value

04:36.840 --> 04:38.090
is going to be empty.

04:38.510 --> 04:38.910
OK.

04:39.210 --> 04:40.720
I'm going to go right here.

04:40.840 --> 04:47.100
Type eletter reactor is going to grab the letter is going to update the state and it's going to read

04:47.100 --> 04:48.770
render this form.

04:48.900 --> 04:51.510
But the banlieue is still going to be empty.

04:51.540 --> 04:55.280
So we always get an an empty value.

04:55.530 --> 05:02.040
So what we need to do right here to update the values right here is we have the values on the state.

05:02.190 --> 05:09.030
What we can do instead of just putting nothing all you can do is just put the state is going to be this

05:09.290 --> 05:17.010
that state that name and begin to do the same thing for the last name so we can save time to put this

05:17.010 --> 05:18.140
one right here.

05:19.690 --> 05:26.340
OK so if i type of f we get an F O on a mistake is not a state of name.

05:26.360 --> 05:32.160
State of last name and it's reloaded.

05:32.220 --> 05:35.530
And if I type Francis is going is working.

05:35.550 --> 05:42.130
We get the update state and everything it's managed through react react.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.610
It's handling whatever is happening right here on the input.

05:45.730 --> 05:52.930
So we are not putting the values manually react it's doing this and this is a perfect example of a controlled

05:52.930 --> 05:54.390
computing component.

05:54.460 --> 05:59.070
Everything it's managed through re-act is matched by react.

05:59.140 --> 06:00.580
Let's go to the next section.

06:00.640 --> 06:08.800
I'm going to convert this to an uncontrolled component using refs and we can see we can check the difference

06:09.100 --> 06:12.410
between creating a controlled and an uncontrolled component.
