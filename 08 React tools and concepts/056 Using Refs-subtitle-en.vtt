00:00.330 --> 00:07.010
OK so now we're going to talk about drafts and we're not going to spend spend a lot of time with refs.

00:07.200 --> 00:11.060
And if you ask why it's because you should not use refs.

00:11.400 --> 00:17.910
Well no because I say it it's because re-act gives you the chance to use them but advised not to do

00:17.910 --> 00:18.480
it.

00:18.510 --> 00:25.860
So ref it's kind of a link or reference we can attach to an element and then we can use this link or

00:25.860 --> 00:29.250
reference to do things in the dorm directly.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.690
And that is the key word.

00:30.720 --> 00:34.640
Doing things in the dorm with the dorm directly with ref.

00:34.650 --> 00:38.520
You can bypass react and interact with them.

00:38.620 --> 00:44.960
So you're not going to be using the state or whatever react it's providing you just go directly to the

00:44.970 --> 00:46.610
norm and do it.

00:46.710 --> 00:51.680
And if you think about it it kind of makes sense why bother in using react.

00:51.720 --> 00:55.020
If you're going to just interact with the DOM yourself.

00:55.190 --> 00:55.580
Yeah.

00:55.830 --> 00:56.690
Makes sense.

00:56.940 --> 00:59.990
So it's kind of hard to explain with words.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.920
I'm just going to show you a dumb example so you can get the idea.

01:04.050 --> 01:08.400
I have a component right here an app component and I have a state.

01:08.430 --> 01:12.370
This state has a title and a color.

01:12.400 --> 01:19.710
Now then inside the Render I have a style Barville and the color is going to be this that state that

01:19.710 --> 01:21.730
color is going to be blue.

01:22.170 --> 01:28.740
And when the application renders the title it's going to have the style which is blue and the text that

01:28.740 --> 01:32.580
it's going to be this that state that data change with graphs.

01:32.850 --> 01:33.360
OK.

01:33.630 --> 01:39.090
And then I get I could have just dealt with a function that it's going to change the text whenever i

01:39.090 --> 01:45.120
just click on change color is going to go to this change text function and it's going to change the

01:45.120 --> 01:46.590
state from red.

01:46.590 --> 01:48.690
I'm sorry from blue to red.

01:48.690 --> 01:52.920
So since we are using right here the state is going to change it to red.

01:53.260 --> 01:54.440
OK that's good.

01:54.480 --> 02:02.610
That's working so we are changing the color using state we're using react to change the state of this

02:03.090 --> 02:03.710
style.

02:03.840 --> 02:04.460
So that's good.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.910
That's what re-act advise us to do.

02:08.250 --> 02:13.610
We have a different way to do it and we can use refs are going to go right here to this component right

02:13.640 --> 02:18.170
here to this 8:04 sorry it's elements not component is going to be rough.

02:18.360 --> 02:25.500
And that's the way we just create create an instance of a ref going to call and do ref and I need to

02:25.530 --> 02:29.740
assign a name just like an ID or a class.

02:29.850 --> 02:34.650
And what I'm gonna do I'm just going to put my title into something simple.

02:34.650 --> 02:35.710
All right.

02:35.730 --> 02:39.830
Now what we can do instead of using the state to change the color.

02:39.950 --> 02:47.030
Going to come in this state and I'm going to go right here right here whenever we have ref we're making

02:47.120 --> 02:49.050
a reference to this.

02:49.050 --> 02:53.100
That ref is going to be like this not props with the props.

02:53.280 --> 02:56.710
But in this case it's going to be this component and ref.

02:56.850 --> 02:59.600
So I'm going to say this that ref.

02:59.740 --> 03:08.320
And we have access to this element so we can do things directly then have two refs o refs plural.

03:08.560 --> 03:14.460
We need to make reference to the name of the ref which is going to be my title and then we can do pretty

03:14.460 --> 03:15.960
much whatever we want.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.790
I'm just going to change the style.

03:17.790 --> 03:23.420
It's going to be style and then color and this one again it's going to be called it's going to be a

03:23.430 --> 03:27.340
red color and this is just vanilla jazz.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.100
It's not sex or whatever.

03:29.210 --> 03:32.050
It's just mutating the color directly.

03:32.070 --> 03:37.680
So if I just reload the application and click and change color we get the same result.

03:37.710 --> 03:43.710
So it's working but we are changing the color directly through graphs.

03:43.710 --> 03:48.100
And again we shouldn't use this as it is.

03:48.300 --> 03:51.250
Let me just show you the documentation.

03:51.640 --> 03:56.590
And for here you have a lot of information about graphs and right here you get don't you.

03:56.620 --> 04:03.510
You know we use refs and right here the top at the very beginning is going to tell you the typical Riak

04:03.510 --> 04:10.820
dataflow prompts are the only way the only way that parent components interact with children.

04:11.070 --> 04:16.650
So pretty much saying you ok the way we wanted you to do it for us.

04:16.740 --> 04:21.190
One you to do it it's going to be using props and not the refs.

04:21.570 --> 04:26.290
So again at the end is going to say re-act provides an escape hatch.

04:26.500 --> 04:32.880
So again you know you shouldn't use it but if you really really really need need need to use it you

04:32.880 --> 04:35.270
need to use this DS refs.

04:35.490 --> 04:45.300
Well you can and right here is going to give you some options where the use of refs is going to be applicable.

04:45.330 --> 04:52.860
It's going to be managing focus or tech selection media playback and triggering in imperative animations

04:53.190 --> 04:56.810
and then just interacting with third party libraries.

04:56.880 --> 05:03.120
And this is just maybe Jay Querrey if you want to interact with Jay Querrey and mutated Dohm directly

05:03.120 --> 05:03.890
with Jacqui.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.270
Well you can do it.

05:05.820 --> 05:06.190
OK.

05:06.190 --> 05:10.890
Again you can use it but you're shooting it for all.

05:10.890 --> 05:11.380
OK.

05:11.430 --> 05:13.440
You should always use it.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.630
OK that's enough.

05:15.630 --> 05:17.600
Let's go to the next topic.

05:17.730 --> 05:24.520
It's going to be control and uncontrolled and we're going to be talking a little bit about refs again.
