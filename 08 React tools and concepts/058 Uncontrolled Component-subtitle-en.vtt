00:01.800 --> 00:06.440
OK so now I'm going to convert this to an uncontrolled component.

00:06.720 --> 00:13.350
So to start getting the lead all the things we don't need and that is the difference between uncontrolled

00:13.380 --> 00:19.900
and controlled just going to delete all of this and I get to go right here and get and just delete the

00:19.910 --> 00:23.960
value and delete of this.

00:23.970 --> 00:24.740
OK.

00:25.920 --> 00:32.200
So since we want to create an uncontrolled component and we want to use refs because that that's an

00:32.220 --> 00:39.140
example going to do just create a ref for this code to say ref This is called and what we can do.

00:39.170 --> 00:40.750
This is some E-6 magic.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.140
Does this just just just to save code.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.220
We can assign to ref the value of this.

00:46.410 --> 00:56.760
So I'm going to say this input is going to be equal to this name and then Ã©cole imposed.

00:57.100 --> 01:03.030
And now instead of making reference whenever we call this to this dog draft's that something and then

01:03.030 --> 01:07.080
the name of the ref just assigned to this that name.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.500
OK let's do the same thing for the other one.

01:10.710 --> 01:16.100
I'm going to say There's that name and instead of name it's going to be last name.

01:17.010 --> 01:17.330
OK.

01:17.340 --> 01:22.560
Now what I'm going to creek I'm going to create a listener for this is going to say create a button

01:23.580 --> 01:26.490
and it's going to be unclick.

01:26.490 --> 01:31.620
And whenever we cook this button we can submit the form and catch data.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.540
We have inside this form.

01:33.840 --> 01:41.760
So I was going to be again just sign up something that makes sense sign up good and this unclick is

01:41.760 --> 01:45.690
going to trigger a function that's going to be handle.

01:45.830 --> 01:54.440
So I've met click one or so this function is just going to graph the data we have inside the refs is

01:54.450 --> 01:55.730
going to be handled submit.

01:55.770 --> 02:03.800
It's going to be equal to an Fatfat or a function and this fat function is going to graph the data it's

02:04.180 --> 02:05.650
going to put it inside of our table.

02:05.670 --> 02:08.620
Because I want to show you what we get from this.

02:08.770 --> 02:12.100
So I'm going to store everything into an object just like state.

02:12.420 --> 02:18.360
So this one is going to be Konst name and the name is going to be against these we make this association

02:18.450 --> 02:25.620
with the A-6 instead of calling this refs dot the name of the ref and then the value what we can do

02:25.710 --> 02:31.830
is we can call this that name this dot name and then just value.

02:32.370 --> 02:38.400
Ok then we have the last name and this just to show you the difference between an in control and control

02:38.400 --> 02:40.080
component with drafts.

02:40.530 --> 02:42.340
So it's a value.

02:42.480 --> 02:43.180
OK.

02:43.470 --> 02:49.470
And at the end whenever it's when everything after everything it's ready I'm just going to cancel log

02:49.890 --> 02:54.250
the values.

02:54.330 --> 02:55.850
I made a mistake once.

02:55.890 --> 03:01.900
Let me check why it's just values is not a value.

03:02.070 --> 03:04.000
I wanted to choose one values.

03:04.210 --> 03:06.430
I go OK.

03:06.480 --> 03:13.270
So if I enter Frances and if I entered Jones is the last name I clicked sign up.

03:13.640 --> 03:18.840
Oh and the form is going to of course is going to just reload the application.

03:18.840 --> 03:23.230
It's because I'm using forms to delete the form because we don't need it right now.

03:23.310 --> 03:33.700
We're using an on click one second I know I know this is because I'm trying to go fast and I made mistakes.

03:33.900 --> 03:34.410
OK.

03:34.490 --> 03:40.350
So I'm going to type Frances and then Joan's going to sign up.

03:40.470 --> 03:40.780
OK.

03:40.820 --> 03:44.130
We get the name and the last name.

03:44.270 --> 03:50.150
And you know all these cunning coding is not to show you how to do the coding is to show you the difference

03:50.600 --> 03:52.300
between a controlled and in control.

03:52.310 --> 03:56.430
And I'm just going to delete this just to simplify the code.

03:56.510 --> 03:57.340
Look at this.

03:57.410 --> 04:00.780
We just did one function with a couple of lines.

04:00.860 --> 04:04.900
The other way the control component we use three different functions.

04:05.090 --> 04:10.720
And we did a lot of logic setting up the state and then updating the state Inside Value.

04:10.840 --> 04:17.600
Well this is the difference making it an uncontrolled component with the forms and refs is really really

04:17.690 --> 04:25.700
easy and there's not a lot of code involved but the with control component you get all the functionalities

04:25.970 --> 04:31.640
from react because you're using re-act for everything but you need to do a lot of set up.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.650
That is the main difference.

04:33.820 --> 04:42.050
Again react react just advice you to use control components anyways and that's what why you should use

04:42.050 --> 04:42.540
it.

04:42.710 --> 04:50.330
And again why bothering using react if at the end it's just going to use refs you know make sense.

04:50.630 --> 04:51.110
OK.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.400
So this is enough for this section.

04:54.530 --> 05:01.820
We're going to start with something new on the next sections and we're going to do a project just put

05:02.150 --> 05:04.190
a lot of time into that project.

05:04.190 --> 05:07.690
I try to emulate real live projects.

05:07.730 --> 05:09.560
So let's go to the next section.
